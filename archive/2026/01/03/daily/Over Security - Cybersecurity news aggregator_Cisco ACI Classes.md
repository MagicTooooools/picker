In the previous post, we introduced the Cisco ACI object model. We saw that we can retrieve objects either by using **Managed Objects (MOs)** or by requesting objects that belong to a specific class.

If we need to retrieve the details of a single object and we know its **DN (Distinguished Name)**, we can issue a specific request to obtain that object and all its details.

However, if we do not know the object’s DN, or if we simply need a list of objects belonging to a given class, we must perform a more generic query.
