## Detailed Introduction

UI/UX Pro Max Skill is an AI skill focused on design and frontend engineering, providing intelligent design support across multiple platforms (mobile, web, desktop). Given design goals and constraints, it produces layout suggestions, component implementation ideas, and styling recommendations to shorten the time from concept to deliverable UI while maintaining consistency and reusability.

## Main Features

* Context-aware layout suggestions and responsive component composition.
* Automatic generation of design guideline highlights and style variants to improve visual consistency.
* Multi-platform adaptation advice (mobile, web, desktop) with attention to accessibility and interaction details.
* Integration-friendly outputs for frontend component libraries and templates.

## Use Cases

* Product design: quickly obtain multiple layout proposals and trade-off analysis to speed iteration.
* Frontend implementation: generate component implementation ideas and style examples to accelerate delivery.
* Design review and standardization: automatically summarize design decisions for team sharing and reuse.

## Technical Features

* Prompt-engineering driven recommendation engine that leverages project context for targeted outputs.
* Supports integration with existing UI component libraries and design systems, producing structured component suggestions and style tokens.
* Accepts multimodal inputs (text + design descriptions) to increase the practicality and actionability of recommendations.
