# CPPA fines data broker selling lists of Alzheimer's patients

The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) said on Thursday that it has fined a Texas-based data broker that was selling sensitive health information without being registered as a data broker in the state.

Rickenbacher Data LLC, which does business as Datamasters, bought and resold the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of millions of people with Alzheimer’s disease, drug addiction, bladder incontinence and other medical conditions for targeted advertising, according to the CPPA.

Datamasters also bought and resold lists which categorized people based on their age, perceived race, political views, banking activities and health-related purchases, CPPA said.

In addition to the $45,000 fine, the CPPA has ordered Datamasters to stop selling Californians personal data.

“Reselling lists of people battling Alzheimer’s disease is a recipe for trouble,” Michael Macko, the head of enforcement at the CPPA, said in a statement. “In the wrong hands, these lists could be used to target people for more than just advertising. The same risks apply to selling lists of seniors, people who identify as conservative or liberal, or people who purchase sensitive health products.”

Datamasters CEO David Rickenbacher did not immediately respond to a message sent to him via LinkedIn.
