# Lego’s Smart Bricks explained: what they do, and what they don’t

by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury) |
January 8, 2026

![Lego Smart Brick](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/smartbrick-1.jpg?w=1200)

Lego just made what it claims is its most important product release since it introduced minifigures in 1978. No, it’s not yet another brand franchise. It’s a computer in a brick.

Called the **Smart Brick**, it’s part of a broader system called **Smart Play** that Lego hopes will revolutionize your child’s interaction with Lego.

These aren’t your grandma’s Lego bricks. The 2×4 techno-brick houses a custom ASIC chip that Lego says is smaller than a single Lego stud, measuring about 4.1mm. Inside are accelerometers, light and sound sensors, an LED array, and a miniature speaker with an onboard synthesizer that generates sound effects in real time, rather than just playing pre-recorded clips.

## How the pieces talk to each other

The bricks charge wirelessly on a dedicated pad and contain batteries that Lego says can last for years. They also communicate with each other to trigger actions, such as interactive sound effects.

This is where the other Smart Play components come in: **Smart Tags** and **Smart Minifigures**. The 2×2 stud-less Smart Tags contain unique digital IDs that tell bricks how to behave. A helicopter tag, for example, might trigger propeller sounds.

There’s also a **Neighbor Position Measurement** system that detects brick proximity and orientation. So a brick might do different things as it gets closer to a Smart Tag or Smart Minifigure, for example.

## The privacy implications of Smart Bricks

Any time parents hear about toys communicating with other devices, they’re right to be nervous. They’ve had to contend with toys that [give up kids’ sensitive personal data](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/02/fisher-price-mattel-smart-toy-bear-data-hack-technology) and allegedly have the potential to [become listening devices for surveillance](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39002142).

However, Lego says its proprietary Bluetooth-based protocol, called **BrickNet**, comes with encryption and built-in privacy controls.

One clear upside is that the system doesn’t need an internet connection for these devices to work, and there are no screens or companion apps involved either. For parents weary of reading about children’s apps quietly harvesting data, that alone will come as a relief.

Lego also makes specific privacy assurances. Yes, there’s a microphone in the Smart Brick, but no, it doesn’t record sound (it’s just a sensor), the company says. There are no cameras either.

Perhaps the biggest relief of all, though, is that there’s no AI in this brick.

At a time when “AI-powered” is being sprinkled over everything from washing machines to toilets, skipping AI may be the smartest design decision here. AI-driven toys come with their own [risks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/2025-exposed-risks-we-ignored-while-rushing-ai), especially when children don’t get a meaningful choice about how that [technology behaves](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/ai-powered-stuffed-animals-a-good-alternative-for-screen-time) once it’s out of the box.

In the past, they’ve been subjected to [sexual content from AI-powered teddy bears](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/ai-teddy-bear-for-kids-responds-with-sexual-content-and-advice-about-weapons). Against that backdrop, Lego’s restraint feels deliberate, and welcome.
