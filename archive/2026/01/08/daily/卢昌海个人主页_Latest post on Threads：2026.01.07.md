Recently, however, my interest was rekindled by the rolling out of Gemini, and I managed to have my Nest acquire a Gemini "core". The result, unfortunately, was mixed: its language capability indeed leaped, and I'm satisfied with that. But there is a ridiculous limitation: to any question, it cuts the conversation right after the answer, which means no follow-up questions, no clarifications, no corrections, et cetera. Would anyone tolerate an assistant that behaves like that? It is almost sabotage to the quasi-human impression people have tried so hard for AI products to achieve. AI might be in a growing phase, but the human intelligence of the Google gentlemen who rolled out such a crippled service seems not.  >>> Later Posts  >>>>>> Follow Me On [Threads](https://www.threads.net/%40lu_changhai) or [X](https://x.com/lu_changhai) <<<<<<  https://www.changhai.org/ | |
