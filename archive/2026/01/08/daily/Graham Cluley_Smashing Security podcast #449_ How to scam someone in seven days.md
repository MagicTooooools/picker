Romance scammers have apparently discovered astrology… and Taurus is their secret weapon.

In episode 449 of “Smashing Security”, we take a look inside an actual romance-fraud handbook – complete with scripts, personality “types”, corporate jargon, and a seven-day plan to get victims from hello to hand over the crypto.

Then Lesley “hacks4pancakes” Carhart delivers a reality check on the dire cybersecurity jobs market for juniors: why entry-level roles are evaporating, how automated CV screening is chewing candidates up, and what hopeful newcomers (and weary veterans) can do about it.

Plus, Graham talks to ThreatLocker CEO Danny Jenkins about why misconfigurations are behind an uncomfortable number of breaches, how default-deny security actually works in practice, and why detecting attacks after they’ve started is already too late.

All this, and much more, in this episode of the “Smashing Security” podcast with Graham Cluley, and special guest Lesley Carhart.
