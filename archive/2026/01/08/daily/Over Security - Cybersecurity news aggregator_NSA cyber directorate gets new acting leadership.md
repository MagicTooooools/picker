# NSA cyber directorate gets new acting leadership

The National Security Agency has a new leadership roster for its cybersecurity directorate as the agency waits for its first Senate-confirmed chief in more than nine months.

David Imbordino, a NSA senior executive who is currently serving as the directorate’s deputy chief, will take the reins in an acting capacity at the end of the month, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Holly Baroody, a senior official at the agency in the United Kingdom, will return as planned from her assignment this summer to be the directorate’s acting No. 2, according to these people. All were granted anonymity to speak candidly about personnel matters.

“The National Security Agency cannot confirm or deny any potential personnel changes,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement.

The cybersecurity directorate has been without a permanent head since early last year when [its top leaders left the NSA](https://therecord.media/nsa-cyber-director-dave-luber-to-retire). Greg Smithberger, the agency’s previous top man in the U.K., who has led the organization in an acting capacity, is retiring at the end of the month.

Established in 2019, the directorate marked a shift for a spy agency once known as “No Such Agency.”

At the time, there were widespread concerns that the U.S. was too reluctant to more broadly share intelligence about potential foreign digital threats and better collaboration was needed with critical infrastructure providers and industry.

Just last month the NSA teamed with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Canada on an advisory that warned about the [danger posed by BRICKSTORM malware](https://therecord.media/cisa-nsa-warn-brickstorm-china).

Imbordino joined the NSA shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. One of his most prominent past assignments was as the co-lead of a joint task force with U.S. Cyber Command assigned to protect the 2020 presidential election from foreign interference.

[The Election Security Group has existed in various forms](https://therecord.media/nsa-cyber-command-election-security-task-force-leaders-2024) since the 2018 midterms. In Imbordino’s case, [he was partnered with then-Army Brig. Gen. William Hartman](https://x.com/NSAGov/status/1202281623326281728), who has led Cyber Command and the NSA in an acting capacity since last April when the previous chief [was abruptly fired](https://therecord.media/gen-timothy-haugh-fired-nsa-cyber-command-trump).

In another notable change at the time for both organizations, Imbordino and Hartman [spoke publicly about potential threats to Election Day](https://www.war.gov/Multimedia/Videos/videoid/762603/).

Prior to serving in the U.K., Baroody was the executive director at Cyber Command. As such she was the command’s top civilian leader. She also previously served as deputy to the commander of the Cyber National Mission Force.

It’s possible both Imbordino and Baroody’s directorate posts are permanent, however nothing is certain until new leadership is installed atop the command and the agency.

[Army Lt. Gen. Josh Rudd](https://therecord.media/joshua-rudd-nomination-cyber-command-nsa) has been picked to helm Cyber Command and the NSA, though it’s unclear when his confirmation hearings will be held.

Tim Kosiba, a former NSA official who the administration [recently turned to take the No. 2 spot at NSA](https://therecord.media/announced-nsa-deputy-director-pick-joe-francescon-not-taking-job), is expected to start work in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Lorna Mahlock has been nominated to be Cyber Command’s next deputy chief.
