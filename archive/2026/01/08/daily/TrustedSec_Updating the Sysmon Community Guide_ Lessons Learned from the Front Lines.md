Over the past few weeks I’ve been spending a significant amount of time updating the [**Sysmon Community Guide**](https://github.com/trustedsec/SysmonCommunityGuide). This wasn’t driven by theory, trends, or what 'should' work on paper. It was driven by what we keep seeing over and over again in real Incident Response engagements.

The timing also happens to line up with an announcement many of us never expected to hear: Mark Russinovich [confirmed](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/native-sysmon-functionality-coming-to-windows/4468112) that **Sysmon will be integrated into Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025 going forward**.

![](https://trusted-sec.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Blog-assets/SysmonComGuideUpdate_Perez/Fig01_Perez_SysmonUpdate.png?w=320&q=90&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1767714799&s=e14f0cba015a12bd7a32c322d30c6610)

While Sysmon still won’t be enabled by default, this announcement signals a shift in how endpoint telemetry is being treated—and it reinforces why getting Sysmon *right* matters now more than ever.

But the guide update itself wasn’t about that announcement. It was about everything we’ve learned about deploying, tuning, breaking, fixing, and relying on Sysmon when it actually matters.

## Why the Guide Needed an Update

I’ve been writing about, teaching, and deploying Sysmon since the early versions, and despite how powerful it is, one of the most persistent frustrations I still run into during Incident Response is the **lack of usable telemetry**.

In many environments:

* Customers overinvest in AV or EDR and assume visibility is 'covered'.
* Default Windows event logs aren’t forwarded anywhere.
* Linux *auditd* logs sit locally and never make it to a SIEM.
  + Or, auditing *is* enabled, but everything is collected and forwarded indiscriminately.

The result is usually the same…too much data and very little signal.

Teams pay for massive storage, yet investigations slow down. Detections become unreliable. Analysts drown in noise. This isn’t a tooling problem—it’s a configuration and design problem.

Sysmon, when configured intentionally, enables teams to be targeted and deliberate. It allows you to decide what actually matters, collect only that data, and forward it in a way that supports detection engineering, threat hunting, and Incident Response. The guide update focuses heavily on that reality.

## Lessons from Real Incidents and what was Updated
