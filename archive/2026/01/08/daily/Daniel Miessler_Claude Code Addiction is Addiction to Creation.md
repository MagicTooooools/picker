# Claude Code Addiction is Addiction to Creation

Even if Claude Code were the actual addiction, it would still be better than porn, TikTok, and Netflix

I'm starting to hear people talk about Claude Code addiction.

*gasp*

First, even if that were true, it would still be an upgrade over Porn, or Netflix, or TikTok. But I don't think the addiction is to Claude Code.

The addiction is actually to *creation*.

Coders can now make 5, 10, or 100 times more than they could make less than a year ago. And people who had ideas but couldn't code can now pretty much do the same.

Forget Claude Code. In fact, put code out of your mind completely.

**It has never been possible for pretty much anyone to go from an idea to a working, beautiful application in a few minutes.**

Never. Never ever ever.

An app that plays music. Or helps you track workouts. Or makes you laugh. Or solves some business problem.

And tens of thousands of people are now—*justifiably*—addicted to the feeling.

There are plenty of addictions to be worried about in the world.

This is not one to add to the list.
