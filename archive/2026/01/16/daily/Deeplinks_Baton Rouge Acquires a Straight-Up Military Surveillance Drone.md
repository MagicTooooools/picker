The Baton Rouge Police Department announced this week that it will begin using [a drone](https://sls.eff.org/technologies/drones-and-robots) designed by military equipment manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Edge Autonomy, making it one of the first local police departments to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a history of primary use in foreign war zones.

According to reporting from [WBRZ ABC2 in Louisiana](https://www.wbrz.com/news/baton-rouge-police-department-says-it-s-the-first-department-in-country-to-use-new-type-of-drone), the drone, training, and batteries, cost about $1 million.
