# Supreme Court hacker posted stolen government data on Instagram

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

12:01 PM PST · January 16, 2026

A hacker posted the personal data of several of his hacking victims on his Instagram account, @ihackthegovernment, according to a court document.

Last week, Nicholas Moore, 24, a resident of Springfield, Tennessee, [pleaded guilty to repeatedly hacking](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/man-to-plead-guilty-to-hacking-us-supreme-court-filing-system/) into the U.S. Supreme Court’s electronic document filing system. At the time, there were no details about the specifics of the hacking crimes Moore was admitting to.

On Friday, [a newly filled document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26490733-usa-v-moore-doc-8/) — first spotted by [Court Watch’s Seamus Hughes](https://x.com/SeamusHughes/status/2012200041461481851) — revealed more details about Moore’s hacks. Per the filing, Moore hacked not only into the Supreme Court systems, but also the network of AmeriCorps, a government agency that runs stipend volunteer programs, and the systems of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides healthcare and welfare to military veterans.

Moore accessed those systems using stolen credentials of users who were authorized to access them. Once he gained access to those victims’ accounts, Moore accessed and stole their personal data and posted some online to his Instagram account: @ihackthegovernment.

In the case of the Supreme Court victim, identified as GS, Moore posted their name and “current and past electronic filing records.”

In the case of the AmeriCorps victim, identified as SM, Moore boasted that he had access to the organization’s servers and published the victim’s “name, date of birth, email address, home address, phone number, citizenship status, veteran status, service history, and the last four digits of his social security number.”

And, in the case of the victim at the Department of Veterans Affairs, identified as HW, Moore posted the victim’s identifiable health information “when he sent an associate a screenshot from HW’s MyHealtheVet account that identified HW and showed the medications he had been prescribed.”

According to the court document, Moore faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000.
