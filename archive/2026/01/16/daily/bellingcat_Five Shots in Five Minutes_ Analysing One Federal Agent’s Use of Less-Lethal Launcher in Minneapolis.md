The fatal [shooting of Renee Nicole Good](https://bsky.app/profile/bellingcat.com/post/3mbwmvgypqc2x) by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis on Jan. 7 sparked [nationwide protests](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/11/trump-news-at-a-glance-death-of-renee-good-at-hands-of-ice-sparks-nationwide-protests), with often [violent clashes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/15/ice-officer-shoots-venezuelan-immigrant-in-minneapolis-what-we-know) breaking out between protesters and federal agents. Some of the most intense protests took place in Minneapolis itself, with an agent using a less-lethal launcher in ways that experts told Bellingcat were “punitive” and “questionable at best”.

This agent, an elite Border Patrol officer who was masked but identifiable through the uniform number patch EZ-17, was captured on camera firing his [B&T GL06](https://bt-usa.com/products/gl06/) 40mm less-lethal launcher at protesters five times in five minutes as he travelled down a street adjacent to where Good was killed.

While “less-lethal” weapons are not designed to kill, they can still result in [serious injuries and even death](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/03/global-dozens-killed-and-thousands-maimed-by-police-misuse-of-rubber-bullets/) when misused. In California, a protester said he was [permanently blinded](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-13/anti-ice-protesters-recount-dhs-agents-encounter-santa-ana) in one eye after he was shot with a less-lethal weapon at a protest on Jan. 13. Footage shows a DHS officer firing a PepperBall gun at his face at close range, causing him to bleed.

Last year, a judge in Illinois ordered an injunction limiting federal agents’ use of force in the state due to what she described as aggressive use of force against peaceful protesters that [“shocks the conscience”](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/judge-ellis-force-lawsuit-noem-bovino-dhs-chicago-immigration-enforcement/). However, Bellingcat found [multiple examples](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/10/31/illinois-immigration-protests/) of force and riot control weapons being used during immigration raids and in apparent violation of that order in the weeks immediately after.

Experts told Bellingcat that most of the less-lethal shots fired by EZ-17 after arriving at the site of Good’s shooting with Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino on Jan. 7, also appear to breach CBP’s [use-of-force](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/exhibit_09_-_cbp_use_of_force_policy_final_jan_2021.pdf#page=20) policy.

Bellingcat analysed videos from news outlets and social media and mapped out all five shots the agent fired.

Four of these shots appeared to be aimed directly at protesters’ faces at close range, while a fifth was fired from a distance towards a crowd after tear gas had already been deployed. A sixth shot, captured at another location on the same day, also shows EZ-17 firing a shot from the same launcher at someone at head-level.

As of publication, DHS had not responded to Bellingcat’s requests for comment.

## The Agent

In footage captured by independent news outlet [Mercado Media](https://youtu.be/6f2uyGkcRco?t=2188), EZ-17 is seen inside the crime scene tape perimeter, standing near Bovino, with eight 40mm munitions on his belt.

These included three [sponge-nose impact rounds](https://www.defense-technology.com/product-category/40mm-munitions-impact-munitions/), which are designed for “[pain compliance](https://www.defense-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/direct-impact-technical-report.pdf)” through the direct force of impact, and five cylindrical munitions that can be filled with [different payloads and chemical irritants](https://www.defense-technology.com/product-category/40mm-munitions/). “BLAST” in blue text is visible on one munition, indicating a “[Muzzle Blast](https://www.defense-technology.com/product/muzzle-blast-40-mm-round-cs/)” munition with a CS gas fill – commonly known as tear gas. At least three additional 40mm munitions are visible in his plate carrier.

Another video by independent news network [Status Coup News](https://www.memberstatuscoup.com/home) showed uninterrupted footage capturing five shots from the time the agent exited [the crime scene perimeter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfiWmX_mTE&t=302s) (at 5:02) shortly before firing the first shot, to when he [left in a truck](https://youtu.be/LnfiWmX_mTE?si=WNYsnnjK-kQF2qs0&t=559) with other agents (9:23) immediately after firing the fifth shot.

The back of EZ-17’s vest shows that he belongs to CBP’s Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC). BORTAC is a specialised and highly trained unit that, [according to the CBP](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Border%20Patrol%20Tactical%20Unit.pdf), has a selection process “designed to mirror aspects of the US Special Operations Forces’ selection courses”.

Members of BORTAC have regularly accompanied Bovino as he leads Trump’s immigration raids, including [EZ-17](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1q8j0bw/icecbp_bortac_unit_just_b...
