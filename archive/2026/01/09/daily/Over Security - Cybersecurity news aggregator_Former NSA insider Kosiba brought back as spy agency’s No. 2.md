# Former NSA insider Kosiba brought back as spy agency’s No. 2

The National Security Agency on Friday formally announced Tim Kosiba as its new deputy chief, ending a months-long episode that saw the Trump administration turn away from a previous pick after far-right criticism.

“It is an honor to come back home and serve as the National Security Agency’s next deputy director,” Kosiba, who previously served in the government for over three decades before leaving in 2021, [said in a statement](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/4374167/national-security-agency-announces-mr-tim-kosiba-as-next-nsa-deputy-director/).

In August the administration announced that Joe Francescon, a former NSA official, would be the No. 2. However, the choice quickly came under fire from far-right activist Laura Loomer, [who claimed Francescon had donated money](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1958643667326889997) to a Democratic congressman.

[Recorded Future News first reported](https://therecord.media/announced-nsa-deputy-director-pick-joe-francescon-not-taking-job) that Francenson was eventually told he would not get the post. He instead took a job in the private sector.

Conservatives within the administration persuaded Trump to turn to Kosiba, who held several senior roles at the FBI and NSA, including as the deputy commander of NSA Georgia, one of the agency’s field hubs

As deputy, Kosiba will oversee much of the spy agency’s day-to-day operations and act as a filter to provide only the most critical information to its chief, who is also the head of U.S. Cyber Command.

“I am confident that Tim will continue to drive and guide us in our critical foreign signals intelligence and cybersecurity missions. His expertise and leadership will be invaluable as we advance our efforts to protect national security interests,” Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman, who has led both agencies in an acting capacity since last April, said in a statement.

With Kosiba in place, attention will now turn to President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the command and the agency, which has gone without a Senate-confirmed leader for more than nine months.

The Senate Armed Services Committee [will hold its confirmation hearing](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/to-consider-the-nominations-of-lieutenant-general-francis-l-donovan-usmc-to-be-general-and-commander-united-states-southern-command-and-lieutenant-general-joshua-m-rudd-usa-to-be-general-and-director-national-security-agency/chief-central-security-service/commander-united-states-cyber-command) for Army Lt. Gen. Joshua Rudd on January 15. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which shares jurisdiction over the nomination, is expected to hold its own hearing the week of January 26.
