### Introduction

Welcome to follow my channel, where I occasionally share random messages

<https://t.me/bboyapp>

Or follow me on Twitter

<https://twitter.com/bboysoulcn>

1. ### My Server Started Mining Monero This Morning

The author was hacked through an Umami analytics tool Next.js vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478), with cryptocurrency mining software planted on the server. Fortunately, container isolation prevented further damage. The issue was ultimately resolved by deleting the container and hardening the firewall.

2. ### It’s Hard to Justify Tahoe Icons

A detailed analysis of the design failure of adding icons to the menu bar in macOS Tahoe, pointing out issues such as inconsistent icons, excessive complexity, and violation of the 1992 Human Interface Guidelines, proving that adding icons to every menu item actually reduces usability.

Apple is really getting worse, but still better than Windows.

3. ### Teaching My Neighbor to Keep the Volume Down

The author discovered that their neighbor’s Dish Network remote control uses the same radio frequency as theirs. Through Pavlovian conditioning training, they would turn off the neighbor’s TV with their remote every time the volume was too loud, eventually successfully training the neighbor to maintain low volume.

4. ### Biodome

A fully automated plant growing project using Arduino sensors and Claude AI to manage the growth of a tomato plant named “Sol”, including automatic watering, light control, CO2 injection, and environmental monitoring, documenting detailed growth data from days 45-46.

5. ### Why is the Gmail App 700 MB?

Exploring the issue of mobile app bloat, where the Gmail app reaches 760MB while the native Mail app is only 8.7MB. Compares app sizes from Google, Microsoft, and other companies, highlighting how application sizes have ballooned 10-100 times without corresponding functionality growth.

6. ### How Browsers Work

An interactive guide explaining how browsers work through hands-on examples, including URL parsing, DNS queries, TCP connections, HTTP request/response, HTML parsing to DOM trees, and the rendering pipeline (layout, painting, compositing) and other core concepts.

7. ### Helene and Mobile Web Performance

During Hurricane Helene, the author experienced government and emergency websites loading slowly and being cluttered with useless media content under limited network conditions. Calls for websites to return to basics, optimize performance, and provide concise text information rather than bloated interactive pages.

Things that could be done with plain HTML insist on being fancy, except for this blog of course.

8. ### WHOIS From Scratch

A detailed introduction to the history of the WHOIS protocol, how it works, and its replacement by RDAP. Demonstrates implementing a WHOIS server and WHOIS-to-RDAP proxy from scratch using Go, showcasing internet protocol evolution and modern API design principles.

9. ### This is NOT the Worst LLM You’ll Ever Use

Through an analogy of car speed development, argues that large language models have hit a growth plateau, with diminishing returns from more computing power and data. Questions the narrative that “LLMs will only get better,” pointing out that real breakthroughs require reliability and efficiency rather than simply scaling up.

<https://idiallo.com/blog/not-the-worst-llm-you-will-ever-use>

10. ### Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers

Detailed account of a self-hosted Git repository experiencing AI crawler attacks, analyzing the power, network, and labor costs caused by scrapers, and systematically introducing the implementation of multi-layered defense measures using nginx caching, rate limiting, manual redirection, and the Iocaine tool.
