## Friday Squid Blogging: The Chinese Squid-Fishing Fleet off the Argentine Coast

The latest [article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/06/squid-argentina-coast-guard-overfishing-ecosystems-animal-cruelty-human-rights-china) on this topic.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

“DHS has now argued in court that a REAL ID is not reliable evidence of U.S. citizenship because states can issue compliant IDs to noncitizens and because agents believe REAL ID can be faked or misused.” [0]
