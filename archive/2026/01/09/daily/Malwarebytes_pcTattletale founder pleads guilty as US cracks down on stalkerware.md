# pcTattletale founder pleads guilty as US cracks down on stalkerware

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 9, 2026

![Stalkerware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/stalkerware_header.jpg?w=1200)

[Reportedly](https://securityboulevard.com/2026/01/owner-of-stalkerware-maker-pctattletale-pleads-guilty-to-hacking/), pcTattletale founder Bryan Fleming has pleaded guilty in US federal court to computer hacking, unlawfully selling and advertising spyware, and conspiracy.

This is good news not just because we despise stalkerware like pcTattletale, but because it is only the second US federal stalkerware prosecution in a decade. It could could open the door to further cases against people who develop, sell, or promote similar tools.

In 2021, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/09/phone-screenshots-accidentally-leaked-online-by-stalkerware-company) that “employee and child-monitoring” software vendor pcTattletale had not been very careful about securing the screenshots it secretly captured from victims’ phones. A security researcher testing a trial version discovered that the app uploaded screenshots to an unsecured online database, meaning anyone could view them without authentication, such as a username and password.

In 2024, we [revisited](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/pctattletale-spyware-leaks-database-containing-victim-screenshots-gets-website-defaced) the app after researchers found it was once again leaking a database containing victim screenshots. One researcher discovered that pcTattletale’s Application Programming Interface (API) allowed anyone to access the most recent screen capture recorded from any device on which the spyware is installed. Another researcher uncovered a separate vulnerability that granted full access to the app’s backend infrastructure. That access allowed them to deface the website and steal AWS credentials, which turned out to be shared across all devices. As a result, the researcher obtained data about both victims and the customers who were doing the tracking.

This is no longer possible. Not because the developers fixed the problems, but because Amazon locked pcTattletale’s entire AWS infrastructure. Fleming later abandoned the product and deleted the contents of its servers.

However, Homeland Security Investigations had already started investigating pcTattletale in June 2021 and did not stop. A few things made Fleming stand out among other stalkerware operators. While many hide behind overseas shell companies, Fleming appeared to be proud of his work. And while others market their products as parental control or employee monitoring tools, pcTattletale explicitly promoted spying on romantic partners and spouses, using phrases such as “catch a cheater” and “surreptitiously spying on spouses and partners.” This made it clear the software was designed for non-consensual surveillance of adults.

Fleming is expected to be sentenced later this year.

## Removing stalkerware

Malwarebytes, as one of the founding members of the [Coalition Against Stalkerware](https://stopstalkerware.org/), makes it a priority to detect and remove stalkerware-type apps from your device.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that removing stalkerware may alert the person spying on you that the app has been discovered. The Coalition Against Stalkerware outlines additional steps and considerations to [help you decide the safest next move](https://sto...
