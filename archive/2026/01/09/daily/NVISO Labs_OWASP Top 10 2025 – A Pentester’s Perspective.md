Every three to four years, OWASP releases a new version of arguably its most famous project, the “OWASP Top Ten”. Originally started in 2003, this list serves as an awareness document to highlight the 10 most prevalent issues for web applications. The newest release marks the eighth iteration and has once again undergone a few key changes.

In this article, we will first take a look back at the project’s evolution over the last 22 years and highlight a few overarching shifts and developments. We will then take a closer look at the newest version and what the changes mean specifically for penetration tests.

# Interactive History

Before we start discussing individual topics, I want to introduce a small tool to help visualize the evolution of the Top 10 over the years:

[![](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png)](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/owasp-top-10-over-time.html)

In the default configuration, it will show the categories for each year and how they moved over time. If you click on a category, it will highlight its entire history and its changes.

At the top, you will also find an option to color the categories based on a selected attribute. For now, there are two options: You can either color all categories by their status, indicating if they are still in the newest version of the Top 10, or you can color them based on their vulnerability class. This class is not something that is taken directly from OWASP. Instead, this is my best attempt at trying to put the categories into various boxes and grouping them into four vulnerability classes. As such, it is subjective and open for discussion, and you might disagree with some or all of the categorization. However, I think it does have a purpose for discussing the overall shifts, as we will see.

# Big Shifts

Let’s take a look at the overarching trends that have shaped the lists over the years.

## Broadening

The biggest trend that can be observed is that the categories in the list have gotten broader and more encompassing over the years. In all of its history, 12 categories have been added to the list, while only 7 have been removed. This is especially true in recent years, as the last time a category was removed was with the 2017 update. Still, 2021 and 2025 introduced 2 and 1 new categories respectively, which means that categories had to be merged to make room for the newcomers.

A good example is the “Injection” category. Throughout most of the history of the Top 10, this used to be two categories, “Injection” and “XSS”. In the 2021 update, they were merged into a single one, and the definition now includes all kinds of injection-related vulnerabilities, not just XSS.

A very similar story can be observed for the “Broken Access Control” category. For a long time, this category used to be split over two separate issues, “Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)” and “Failure to Restrict URL Access”, before being merged into the more generic category. If we look at the CWEs assigned to this category in the 2021 and 2025 versions, even “Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)” is now considered to be part of it. However, this has been omitted from the graph, as this merge is not mentioned as an official one in the 2017 update. As the latest addition to the “Broken Access Control” category, “Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)” (which just had its debut four years ago) was merged into this category as well.

In summary, this means that categories are moving away from narrowly defined specific vulnerabilities towards wider, more abstract classes of issues. Compared to earlier years, when categories often referred to very specific vulnerabilities, we now have very broad catch-all terms that capture a lot of specific issues.

## Shift-Left

The industry overall has been “shifting left” for quite some time now, and it makes sense that the Top 10 follows this trend. Once again, the classification into the vulnerability classes is subjective, but sufficient to witness an overarching trend.

In the early years, the list was always topped by technical vulnerabilities. “Injection” (and its sibling “XSS”) held the A01 spot for most of the project’s lifetime. In the last two versions, it has been surpassed by “Broken Access Control” and has been relegated to spots 3 and 5, respectively.

It becomes even clearer if we focus on “Security Misconfiguration”. Starting at the very bottom of the first list as A10, this category was even removed in 2007 before it was reintroduced in 2010. It then held on to the middle of the pack, and in the newest iteration has been promoted to A02.

But probably the biggest example of the shift-left trend is the addition of “Insecure Design” in 2021. This was very surprising at the time, since such a control was previously never part of the Top 10 and is more “left” than any other category has been.

In summary, we can see that the earlier years were dominated by technical vulnerabilities and logic issues, with configuration problems and design issues only appearing towards the bottom of the list. Nowadays, however, configuration and design make up half of the list.

The shift left is, of course, due to a couple of very good reasons. Almost no applications nowadays are developed entirely from scratch. Frameworks are often used, especially for key parts like persistent data storage or output rendering. This leads to a situation where a vulnerability like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting almost requires additional effort from the developers to introduce.

## Quo Vadis

Where do these changes and trends lead us to? Initially the Top 10 was meant to be a list of “vulnerabilities that require immediate remediation”. The target audience were developers, their managers, but also security professionals who “should include these items in their reviews”.

However, as we have seen, over the years the categories have only gotten broader and less concrete, with half of a...
