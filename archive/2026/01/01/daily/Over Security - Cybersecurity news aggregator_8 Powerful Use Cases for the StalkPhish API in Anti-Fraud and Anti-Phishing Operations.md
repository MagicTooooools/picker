Phishing remains one of the most persistent threats facing organizations today. According to recent reports, phishing attacks account for over 80% of reported security incidents, with the average cost of a data breach reaching millions of dollars. The challenge isn’t just detecting phishing—it’s detecting it *fast enough* to protect your customers, your brand, and your bottom line.

The [StalkPhish API](https://stalkphish.io/documentation/fullapi/) provides security teams with programmatic access to a continuously updated database of phishing threats, complete with enriched metadata, threat intelligence, and advanced search capabilities. But what does that mean in practice?

Let’s explore eight concrete use cases where the StalkPhish.io API delivers measurable value.

---

## 1. Brand Protection and Impersonation Detection

**Relevant endpoints:** `/search/brand/`, `/search/url/`, `/search/title/`

Your brand is one of your most valuable assets—and cybercriminals know it. Brand impersonation attacks don’t just steal credentials; they erode customer trust and damage your reputation.

With StalkPhish, security teams can continuously monitor for unauthorized use of their brand across phishing infrastructure. By querying brand names, product names, and corporate keywords across URLs and page titles, you can identify impersonation campaigns *before* they reach your customers.

The temporal filters (`last_hours`, `last_days`) enable real-time alerting workflows. When a new phishing site targeting your brand appears, you can trigger immediate takedown procedures—often shutting down attacks within hours rather than days.

**Example query:**

```
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.stalkphish.io/api/v1/search/brand/YourBrand?last_hours=24"
```

## 2. SOC/SIEM Enrichment for Faster Triage

**Relevant endpoints:** `/search/url/`, `/search/ipv4/`

Every minute an analyst spends manually researching a suspicious URL is a minute not spent on actual threats. The StalkPhish API integrates directly into your existing security stack—Splunk, QRadar, Elastic, Microsoft Sentinel—to automatically enrich indicators of compromise (IOCs).

When your detection rules flag a suspicious URL or IP address, the API instantly returns context: ASN information, targeted brand, kit family, and historical sightings. This transforms a generic alert into actionable intelligence.

The result? Analysts can triage alerts in seconds instead of minutes, focusing their expertise on incidents that truly require human judgment.

**Integration benefit:** Reduce mean time to qualification (MTTQ) from 5+ minutes to under 30 seconds per alert.

## 3. Threat Hunting Across Malicious Infrastructure

**Relevant endpoints:** `/search/ipv4/`, `/search/favicon/`, `/search/zipfilehash/`

Threat actors rarely operate in isolation. A single phishing domain is often part of a larger infrastructure—multiple domains sharing the same IP, the same favicon, the same domain or the same phishing kit.

StalkPhish enables threat hunters to pivot across these technical indicators:

* **IP pivoting:** Discover all phishing domains hosted on a suspicious IP address
* **Favicon hash search:** The MMH3 hash of a favicon can reveal dozens of related phishing sites, even when domains and IPs change
* **Kit hash correlation:** Identify all deployments of a specific phishing kit across your entire threat landscape

This approach transforms isolated indicators into comprehensive infrastructure maps, revealing the full scope of an adversary’s operations.

**Pro tip:** Combine favicon hash searches with temporal filters to track how a threat actor’s infrastructure evolves over time.

## 4. Email/Telegram Exfiltration Channel Detection

**Relevant endpoint:** `/search/telegram/`

Modern phishing kits increasingly rely on Telegram bots and channels to exfiltrate stolen credentials in real time, or still use mailboxes. Unlike traditional email drops, Telegram provides attackers with instant notifications, easy automation, and perceived anonymity.

StalkPhish extracts Telegram bot usernames and channel references directly from phishing kits, creating a unique intelligence layer. Security teams can:

* **Request platform takedowns:** Report malicious bots to Telegram for removal
* **Track actor activity:** The same bot username across multiple campaigns often indicates a single threat actor
* **Alert potential victims:** Identify which brands and campaigns are feeding specific exfiltration channels

This capability is particularly valuable for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms where stolen credentials are monetized within minutes.

**Example query:**

```
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.stalkphish.io/api/v1/search/telegram/phish_bot?last_days=30"
```

## 5. Customer Protection for Financial Services and E-Commerce

**Relevant endpoints:** `/search/url/`, `/search/title/`, `/last`

Banks, payment processors, and online retailers face a constant stream of phishing attacks targeting their customers. The StalkPhish API enables proactive protection at multiple touchpoints:

* **Transaction screening:** Flag or block transactions originating from known phishing referrers
* **Mobile app protection:** Warn use...
