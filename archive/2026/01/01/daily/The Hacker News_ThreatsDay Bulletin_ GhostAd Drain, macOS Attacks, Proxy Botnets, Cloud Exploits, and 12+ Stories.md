The first ThreatsDay Bulletin of 2026 lands on a day that already feels symbolic — new year, new breaches, new tricks. If the past twelve months taught defenders anything, it's that threat actors don't pause for holidays or resolutions. They just evolve faster. This week's round-up shows how subtle shifts in behavior, from code tweaks to job scams, are rewriting what "cybercrime" looks like in practice.

Across the landscape, big players are being tested, familiar threats are mutating, and smaller stories are quietly signaling bigger patterns ahead. The trend isn't about one big breach anymore; it's about many small openings that attackers exploit with precision.

The pace of exploitation, deception, and persistence hasn't slowed; it's only become more calculated. Each update in this edition highlights how the line between normal operations and compromise is getting thinner by the week.

Here's a sharp look at what's moving beneath the surface of the cybersecurity world as 2026 begins.

1. KMSAuto malware scam busted

   [Lithuanian National Extradited to S. Korea for Allegedly Distributing Malware](https://www.police.go.kr/user/bbs/BD_selectBbs.do?q_bbsCode=1002&q_bbscttSn=20251229071522142)

   A Lithuanian national has been arrested for his alleged involvement in infecting 2.8 million systems with clipboard-stealing malware disguised as the KMSAuto tool for illegally activating Windows and Office software. The 29-year-old man has been extradited from Georgia to South Korea. "From April 2020 to January 2023, the hacker distributed 2.8 million copies worldwide of malware disguised as an illegal Windows license activation program (KMSAuto)," South Korean authorities [said](https://www.police.go.kr/user/bbs/BD_selectBbs.do?q_bbsCode=1002&q_bbscttSn=20251229071522142). "Through this malware, the hacker stole virtual assets worth approximately KRW 1.7 billion ($1.2 million) in 8,400 transactions from users of 3,100 virtual asset addresses." The suspect is alleged to have used KMSAuto as a lure to trick victims into downloading a malicious executable that functioned as a clipper malware.
2. Holiday ColdFusion exploit spree

   [Coordinated Campaign Targets Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2025-12-26-coldfusion/)

   A new "coordinated exploitation" campaign has been observed targeting Adobe ColdFusion servers over the Christmas 2025 holiday period. "The attack appears to be a single threat actor operating from Japan-based infrastructure (CTG Server Limited)," GreyNoise [said](https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2025-12-26-coldfusion/). "This source was responsible for ~98% of attack traffic, systematically exploiting 10+ ColdFusion CVEs from 2023-2024." The activity originated from 8 unique IP addresses and leveraged over 10 different CVEs (CVE-2023-26359, CVE-2023-38205, CVE-2023-44353, CVE-2023-38203, CVE-2023-38204, CVE-2023-29298, CVE-2023-29300, CVE-2023-26347, CVE-2024-20767, and CVE-2023-44352) to target the U.S., Spain, India, Canada, Chile, Germany, Pakistan, Cambodia, Ecuador, and France. Some of the payloads deployed following the exploitation enable direct code execution, credential harvesting (by accessing "/etc/passwd"), and JNDI lookups.
3. Android tablets backdoored

   [Kaspersky Discovers New Keenadu Pre-Installed Malware](https://x.com/kaspersky/status/2005579512801599812)

   Kaspersky said it discovered pre-installed malware on certain models of tablets running Android. The malware has been codenamed Keenadu. "It's a backdoor in libandroid\_runtime.so," the Russian cybersecurity company [said](https://x.com/kaspersky/status/2005579512801599812). While the company has yet to provide additional details, backdoors of this kind can allow remote access for data exfiltration, command execution, and other forms of post-exploitation.
4. AI jailbreak hub shut down

   [r/ChatGPTjailbreak Subreddit Banned](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules)

   Reddit has taken the step of banning r/ChatGPTJailbreak, a community of over 229,000 users dedicated to finding workarounds and jailbreaks for safety filters and guardrails erected by developers of large language models (LLMs). Reddit said the "community was banned for violating [Rule 8](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules)," which refers to any effort that could break the site or interfere with its normal use. "Do not interrupt the serving of Reddit, introduce malicious code onto Reddit, make it difficult for anyone else to use Reddit due to your actions, block sponsored headlines, create programs that violate any of our other API rules, or assist anyone in misusing Reddit in any way," the rule [states](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043512931-Don-t-break-the-site). The move follows a [WIRED report](https://www.wired.com/story/google-and-openais-chatbots-can-strip-women-in-photos-down-to-bikinis/) about how some chatbot users were sharing instructions on generating non-consensual deepfakes using photos of fully clothed women. Following the ban, the community has resurfaced at [chatgptjailbreak.tech](https://chatgptjailbreak.tech) on a federated alternative called Lemmy. While the subreddit sprang forth as a red teaming hub for discussing AI jailbreaks, it goes without saying that content shared on the forum had the potential to trigger indirect prompt injections, given that the data (along with everything else posed on the platform) powers Reddit Answers, and serves as a r...
