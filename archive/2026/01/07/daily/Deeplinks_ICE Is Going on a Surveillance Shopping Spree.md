U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new budget under the current administration, and they are going on a surveillance tech shopping spree. Standing at [$28.7 billion dollars for the year 2025 (nearly triple their 2024 budget)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex) and at least another $56.25 billion over the next three years, ICE's budget would be the envy of many national militaries around the world. Indeed, this budget would put ICE as the [14th most well-funded military in the world, right between Ukraine and Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_highest_military_expenditures).

There are many different agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that deal with immigration, as well as non-immigration related agencies such as Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ICE is specifically the enforcement arm of the U.S. immigration apparatus. Their stated mission is to “[p]rotect America through criminal investigations and enforcing immigration laws to preserve national security and public safety.”

Of course, ICE doesn’t just end up targeting, [surveilling](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/ice-wants-go-after-dissenters-well-immigrants), [harassing](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will), [assaulting](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/06/vancouver-ice-alleged-crushing-legs/), [detaining](https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/woman-says-she-was-detained-by-ice-in-minneapolis-for-being-a-citizen-observer/), and [torturing](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/12/estados-unidos-nuevas-investigaciones-revelan-violaciones-de-derechos-humanos-en-los-centros-de-detencion-de-alligator-alcatraz-y-krome-en-florida/) people who are undocumented immigrants. They have [targeted people](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will) on [work permits](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/30/tacoma-hillsboro-victor-cruz-ice-immigration-oregon-law-enforcement/), [asylum seekers](ht...
