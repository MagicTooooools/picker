# One million customers on alert as extortion group claims massive Brightspeed data haul

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 7, 2026

![Brightspeed logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/brightspeed_logo.png?w=1200)

US fiber broadband company Brightspeed is investigating claims by the Crimson Collective extortion group that it stole sensitive data belonging to more than 1 million residential customers, including extensive personally identifiable information (PII), as well as account and billing details.

Brightspeed is one of the largest fiber broadband providers in the US and serves customers across 20 states.

On January 4, the Crimson Collective posted this message on its Telegram channel:

![Telegram post Crimson Collective about Brightspeed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Telegram.png)
> “If anyone has someone working at BrightSpeed, tell them to read their mails fast!
>
> We have in our hands over 1m+ residential user PII’s, which contains the following:
>
> * Customer/account master records containing full PII such as names, emails, phone numbers, billing and service addresses, account status, network type, consent flags, billing system, service instance, network assignment, and site IDs.
> * Address qualification responses with address IDs, full postal addresses, latitude and longitude coordinates, qualification status (fiber/copper/4G), maximum bandwidth, drop length, wire center, marketing profile codes, and eligibility flags.
> * User-level account details keyed by session/user IDs, overlapping with PII including names, emails, phones, service addresses, account numbers, status, communication preferences, and suspend reasons.
> * Payment history per account, featuring payment IDs, dates, amounts, invoice numbers, card types and masked card numbers (last 4 digits), gateways, and status; some entries indicate null or empty histories.
> * Payment methods per account, including default payment method IDs, gateways, masked credit card numbers, expiry dates, BINs, holder names and addresses, status flags (Active/Declined), and created/updated timestamps.
> * Appointment/order records per billing account, with customer PII such as names, emails, phones, addresses, order numbers, status, appointment windows, dispatch and technician information, and install types.
>
> Sample will be dropped on monday night time, letting them some time first to answer to us. (UTC+9, Japan is quite fun for new years while dumping company data)”

The promised sample was later made available and contains 50 entries from each of the following database tables:

* [get-account-details]
  ![account details sample](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/sample.png)
* [getAddressQualification]
* [getUserAccountDetails]
* [listPaymentHistory]
* [listPaymentMethods]
  ![payment methods sample](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/sample2.png)
* [user-appointments]

In a separate Telegram message, the group also claimed it had disconnected a large number of Brightspeed customers. However, this allegation appears only in the group’s own messaging and has not been corroborated by any public reporting.

While there are some customer complaints circulating on social media, it remains unclear whether these issues are actually caused by any actions taken by the Crimson Collective.
