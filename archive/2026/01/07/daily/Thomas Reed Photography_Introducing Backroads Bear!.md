# Introducing Backroads Bear!

I have been working in the tech industry for a long time, but my real passion has always been photography and the outdoors. At long last, I have decided to start up a new tour guide and travel concierge business in Big Sky, Montana, called [Backroads Bear Adventures](https://backroadsbear.com)!

We provide tours and travel assistance in Big Sky, Yellowstone, and the surrounding area (all part of what’s known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem). Whatever you’re interested in, we’ll either provide it ourselves or help you book with trusted partners.

If you’ve never been to Yellowstone, there’s a good reason it’s referred to as the Serengeti of North America. The opportunities to see wildlife and breathtaking natural landscapes are unparalleled in the lower 48 states. Our local knowledge will help maximize your enjoyment of the park and the surrounding national forest and wilderness areas.

For more information, see the link to our website above, or go directly to our [guided photo tour](https://www.backroadsbear.com/photo-tours/), [guided adventure](https://www.backroadsbear.com/adventures/), and [travel concierge](https://www.backroadsbear.com/travel-concierge/) pages. Let us help you make your visit spectacular!
