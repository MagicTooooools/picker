# Inside the Strike: The US Munition That Hit a Residential Building in Venezuela

January 7, 2026

A Bellingcat investigation has identified remnants of an [AGM-88 series](https://cdn.northropgrumman.com/-/media/Project/Northrop-Grumman/ngc/what-we-do/advanced-weapons/AARGM-Datasheet.pdf?rev=45a450048b984b988abed9ac2036a6df) missile inside a three-storey apartment complex that was hit in Catia La Mar during the US military raid on Venezuela on Jan. 3, 2026 that [reportedly killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/venezuela-airstrike-civilian-deaths.html) at least one civilian.

According to the Venezuelan independent media outlet, [El Pitazo](https://elpitazo.net/politica/55-muertos-identificados-en-ataques-de-ee-uu-21-militares-venezolanos-2-mujeres-civiles-y-32-cubanos-entre-las-victimas/), Rosa Gonzalez, 79, was killed in this airstrike in the city of [Catia La Mar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/om1q287XggH5tyEd7) in La Guaira State, 30 km north of the capital Caracas. The attack [reportedly](https://elpitazo.net/politica/55-muertos-identificados-en-ataques-de-ee-uu-21-militares-venezolanos-2-mujeres-civiles-y-32-cubanos-entre-las-victimas/) left a second individual severely wounded.

Bellingcat asked the US Department of Defense to confirm our findings. However, they stated that “a Battle Damage Assessment is ongoing”. We also reached out to the Department of State but they did not respond to our questions at the time of publication.

The Jan. 3 US attack on Venezuela [targeted](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvxnlw1pzo) multiple locations across the country, including military installations and areas within and around the capital, Caracas. US military helicopters, jets and drones provided cover for an assault force that landed at Fort Tiuna,  the largest military complex in Caracas; captured President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores, and flew them out of the country.

About 75 people, including civilians, were killed in the operation, US officials familiar with the matter [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/06/maduro-raid-death-toll/) the Washington Post. Among the military fatalities were [32 Cuban](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/articles/cy8pyx2l3r1o) and [21 Venezuelan soldiers](https://elpitazo.net/politica/55-muertos-identificados-en-ataques-de-ee-uu-21-militares-venezolanos-2-mujeres-civiles-y-32-cubanos-entre-las-victimas/), according to various media reports.

According to [El Pitazo](https://elpitazo.net/politica/55-muertos-identificados-en-ataques-de-ee-uu-21-militares-venezolanos-2-mujeres-civiles-y-32-cubanos-entre-las-victimas/), a second woman, Yohana Rodríguez Sierra, 45, was killed, and her daughter wounded, in other strikes at a communications station at Cerro El Volcán. Multiple residential houses were also [reportedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6AhEaitYwQ) destroyed in the nearby area of [La Boyera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qCnm2rrMz1oSX1ie9).

The military operation in Caracas follows a series of attacks on alleged drug boats which have [reportedly](https://airwars.org/conflict/u-s-military-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/) killed at least 114 in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

## Identifying the Munition

Bellingcat has found videos showing the aftermath of the Catia La Mar attack and remnants of the munition filmed at the location. The strike destroyed some exterior walls of one apartment complex and caused extensive damage to at least two apartments.

Bellingcat geolocated the apartment complex to an area in Catia La Mar about 30 km north of Caracas ([10.592796, -67.037721](https://www.google.com/maps/place/10%C2%B035%2734.1%22N%2B67%C2%B002%2715.8%22W/%4010.592796%2C-67.0402959%2C952m/data%3D%213m2%211e3%214b1%214m4%213m3%218m2%213d10.592796%214d-67.037721?authuser=0&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)) and approximately 500 m east of a targeted air defence storage inside a military facility.

One video also reveals remnants of a munition. According to an analysis of visual evidence by Bellingcat, the remnants appear to show an [AGM-88 series missile](https://cdn.northropgrumman.com/-/media/Project/Northrop-Grumman/ngc/what-we-do/advanced-weapons/AARGM-Datasheet.pdf?rev=45a450048b984b988abed9ac2036a6df).

Another remnant of the AGM-88 series missile appears in a [video](https://www.euronews.com/video/2026/01/05/venezuela-deals-with-aftermath-of-us-strikes-on-catia-la-mar) published by Euronews. This remnant is a BSU-60 tail fin, that according to an [analyst note](https://osmp.ngo/osmp1263/) on the Open Source Munitions Portal (OSMP), is used exclusively with the AGM-88 series missile.
