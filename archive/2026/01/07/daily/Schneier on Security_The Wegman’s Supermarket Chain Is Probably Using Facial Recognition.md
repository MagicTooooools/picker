The next step is personalized pricing, where people are charged variable markup based on their profile.

Yeah, it is. The guy who scoped and designed it is a local CCIE Security certificate holder.

> Wegmans said it does not share biometric data with any third party.

Even if true, why on earth would it be ok for them to have it and bad for someone else to have it? And even if today’s corporate management sticks to this, why would I believe that future management won’t change course in a year, or 10 years, or 20 years, or 50? This isn’t a bell you can un-ring.

It sounds like the police feed Wegman’s a list of people they are interested in. Wegman’s helpfully gathers voiceprints, video, and eye scans (!) from everyone that walks in and feeds them into something that can identify people from the data gathered. Then they pass that information back to the police.

Surveillance pricing will just be a little frosting for them.

@paul

He’d be persona-non-grata in any social circle I’m in were he a local.

Thank you very much for posting this. Reading the article, I notice that there are Wegmans stores in Connecticut, the state that we’re likely to be moving to next year. Now I know not to patronize them. Doesn’t matter if the tech is only being used in NYC, I won’t give my custom to such a corp if I can knowingly avoid it.

Per KS, Instacart already has algorithmic pricing but says it’s not based on individual information. <https://socraticgadfly.blogspot.com/2025/12/dont-trust-those-grocery-prices-but.html>

A new Wegman’s just opened about six months ago here. My wife’s been wanting to go… but I want to ask the manager if they are. If so, tell him that we won’t patronize his store, *and* I’ll tell locals on nextdoor that they do it.

**Immigrants of bosnian muslim origin, government employees in ideho (Police, Courts, Corrections) are running and operating IP Theft websites and have destroyed a Christian Family for exposing them. The rest of the government employees in ideho have all supported their muslim co-workers, specifically in liberal city of BOZO ideho thus**

ROUND THEM UP AND SHIP ‘EM BACK TO BUHZNYUH ALONG WITH ALL OTHER LIBERAL GARBAGE THAT MOVED HERE FROM california – destroying our CHRISTIAN VALUES.

<https://fingermark.ai> has been on my radar for a while. I don’t have the capability to do a deep verification, but their Point Of Sale system shows all the hallmarks of a video based surveillance system backed by AI analysis.

They’re showing up everywhere in Canada, video is embedded in the POS and existing cameras co-opted throughout a client’s place of business, backed by AI analysis, to fine tune analytics and sales conversions right at the POS in real time. The backend is used to surveil staff and report ‘inefficiencies’ or ‘deviations from procedure’ from camera data.

The horse has long since left the barn and there doesn’t seem to be a politician on the field willing to stand up for our rights.

Thank you for your ongoing attention to these matters Bruce.
