# How AI made scams more convincing in 2025

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 2, 2026

![convicted AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/convicted_AI.png?w=1200)

*This blog is part of a series where we highlight new or fast-evolving threats in consumer security. This one focuses on how [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) is being used to design more realistic campaigns, accelerate [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering), and how AI agents can be used to target individuals.*

Most cybercriminals stick with what works. But once a new method proves effective, it spreads quickly—and new trends and types of campaigns follow.

In 2025, the rapid development of [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) and its use in cybercrime went hand in hand. In general, AI allows criminals to improve the scale, speed, and personalization of social engineering through realistic text, voice, and video. Victims face not only financial loss, but erosion of trust in digital communication and institutions.

## Social engineering

### Voice cloning

One of the main areas where AI improved was in the area of voice-cloning, which was immediately picked up by scammers. In the past, they would mostly stick to impersonating friends and relatives. In 2025, they went as far as [impersonating senior US officials](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/05/scammers-are-using-ai-to-impersonate-senior-officials-warns-fbi). The targets were predominantly current or former US federal or state government officials and their contacts.

In the course of these campaigns, cybercriminals used test messages as well as AI-generated voice messages. At the same time, they did not abandon the distressed-family angle. A woman in Florida was tricked into handing over thousands of dollars to a scammer after [her daughter’s voice was AI-cloned](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/car-crash-victim-calls-mother-for-help-and-15k-bail-money-but-its-an-ai-voice-scammer) and used in a scam.

### AI agents

Agentic AI is the term used for individualized AI agents designed to carry out tasks autonomously. One such task could be to [search for publicly available or stolen information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/inside-malwarebytes/2025/10/how-scammers-use-your-data-to-create-personalized-tricks-that-work) about an individual and use that information to compose a very convincing [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) lure.

These [agents could also be used to extort victims](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/new-ai-agents-could-hold-people-for-ransom-in-2025) by matching stolen data with publicly known email addresses or social media accounts, composing messages and sustaining conversations with people who believe a human attacker has direct access to their [Social Security number](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web), physical address, credit card details, and more.

Another use we see frequently is AI-assisted vulnerability discovery. These tools are in use by both attackers and defenders. For example, Google uses a project called Big Sleep, which has found several [vulnerabilities in the Chrome browser](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/chrome-zero-day-under-active-attack-visiting-the-wrong-site-could-hijack-your-browser).

### Social media
