# Cisco XDR in 30: Turning Security Signals Into Confident Action

## How network-led Cisco XDR helps teams see threats clearly and respond faster

Sponsored Post Security teams are being asked to do more with less, while the environments they protect continue to grow in size and complexity. Alerts arrive from dozens of tools, each offering a partial view of risk. The real challenge is no longer finding potential threats, but deciding which ones matter and how quickly to act.

That problem sits at the heart of an upcoming [Cisco webinar, XDR in 30: See the Threat, Know the Verdict, Act Fast](https://cloudsecurity.cisco.com/xdr-in-30?utm_medium=media-email&utm_campaign=xdr-fy26-q2-emea-0120-webi-xdr-in-30&utm_term=the-register&utm_content=xdr-in-30). In a focused 30 minute session, Cisco security experts will explain how a network-led approach to extended detection and response can help teams move from fragmented signals to clear, defensible decisions, without slowing operations.

Many XDR platforms still rely heavily on endpoint data, attempting to bolt on context from elsewhere later. Cisco takes a different approach. By starting with the network, Cisco XDR correlates activity across endpoints, users, cloud workloads and traffic flows from the outset. This broader perspective helps surface early indicators that siloed tools often miss, particularly wh...
