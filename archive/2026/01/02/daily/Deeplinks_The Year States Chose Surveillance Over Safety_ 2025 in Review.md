2025 was the year [age verification](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology) went from a [fringe policy experiment](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/08/08/age-law-online-porn-00110148) to a sweeping reality across the United States. [Half of the U.S.](https://www.404media.co/missouri-age-verification-law-porn-id-check-vpns/) now mandates age verification for accessing adult content or social media platforms. [Nine states](https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/) saw their laws take effect this year alone, with more coming in 2026.

The good news is that courts have blocked many of the laws seeking to impose age-verification gates on social media, largely for the same reasons that EFF opposes these efforts.  Age-verification measures [censor the internet](https://www.eff.org/pages/age-gates-threaten-expressive-rights-every-internet-user#main-content) and burden access to online speech. Though age-verification mandates are often touted as "[online safety](https://www.eff.org/pages/age-verification-wont-protect-children#main-content)" measures for young people, the laws actually do [more harm than good](https://www.eff.org/pages/whos-harmed-age-verification-mandates#main-content). They undermine the fundamental speech rights of [adults and young people alike](https://www.eff.org/document/age-verification-harms-users-all-ages), create new barriers to internet access, and put at risk all internet users' privacy, [anonymity](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/why-isnt-online-age-verification-just-showing-your-id-person), and [security](https://www.eff.org/pages/does-tech-even-work#main-content).

If you're feeling overwhelmed by this onslaught of laws and the invasive technologies behind them, you're not alone. That's why we've launched EFF's Age Verification Resource Hub at [EFF.org/Age](https://www.eff.org/age)—a one-stop sh...
