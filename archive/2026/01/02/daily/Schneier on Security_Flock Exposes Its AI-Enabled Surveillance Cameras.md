## Flock Exposes Its AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras

404 Media has the [story](https://www.404media.co/flock-exposed-its-ai-powered-cameras-to-the-internet-we-tracked-ourselves/):

> Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles. Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people’s faces as they walk through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock’s website. We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path. The camera’s resolution was good enough that we were able to see that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading videos on his phone.

@ Bruce,

Flock are basically the least secure of oh so many systems that really do not serve a community benefit in a lawful way. And the insecurity enables others to not just “look over the shoulder of the operator in real time, many of them store video for later replay that can be recallrd remotely…

Which means researchers and others can see what the operators are doing…

You’ve heard of “up-skirting” cameras… Well the PTZ cameras mounted up above head hight but not more than street sign hight are known by some in the industry as “down blouse” cameras or similar.

The fact is that type of abuse carried out by remote human controlled camera operators is quite shocking.

All these cameras all over the place, and yet when an actual crime takes place, the police always have a hard time finding who really did it.

For those who don’t know the researcher, Benn Jordan, he’s a musician and producer who started using technology skills to research bigger issues. I was a proud supporter of his YouTube channel for his research on sound an environment and I was so happy to see that my money went to fund this research instead. You can find him in Patreon.

Well, my response to a peeping Tom,

There are so many fascinating aspects to this. As a quick aside, I didn’t know that HOAs compose a non-trivial share of Flock’s market. An annual subscription per camera might run in the ballpark of $2,500 to $3,000. Also [interesting](https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-flock-ceo-includes-charlottesville-staunton-in-email-blaming-activists-for-cities-dropping-the-companys-services/) that a number of cities have ended their contract with Flock.

@ KC, ALL,

With regards,

> “There are so many fascinating aspects to this.”

Yes, and one thought that occured is that I suspect putting malware on the cameras is not that difficult…

Which in turn brings up a thought about the cameras actually being as source of OsInt on what the local authorities are taking an interest in…

Back a long long time ago, the people that first used “bugging devices” like the “infinity bug” was not State or Federal law enforcement or even the CIA but what was called back then The Mafia, who bugged the FBI[1].

Thus those in the know could keep an eye not just all around where they are but also see when others were connecting and what IP address etc and work out who was taking interest in them. So in effect not just OSInt but a way of implementing “counter surveillance at next to no cost and near invisibility to those running surveillance. Something that might say be of use currently to some in Minnesota and the “Somali Fraud” issues,

<https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/31/politics/trump-walz-minnesota-child-care-fraud>

Where coincidentally premises under investigation had “strange but timely” burglaries happen. Where the only things stolen were administrative and financial records. These occured just before state and federal investigators could seize the records. Oh and also the burglars apparently also made very odd holes in walls[3].

[1] They got into the phones of the FBI and turned them into “room surveillance” they could just dial into and use. The bug contained a “tone relay” that when activated “latched closed” and held the phone line open. All you needed was a harmonica to activate the bug. It was actually a nice little design for the time. What is not so clear is that a similar design was later used by the Russians for the “Great Grain Robbery”[2] as it became known.

[2] Due to unfavourable weather and very poor political management the Soviet winter grain production was a total disaster and starvation was likely to happen. Something that had happened before a number of times and had lead to entire regions starving with murder and cannibalism as a result.

In 1972 the Soviets cooked up a plan to manipulate down the price of US wheat and buy as much as they could. The US had an excess of grain in Government storage so Kisenger agreed to a trade deal to negotiate the selling of the excess...
