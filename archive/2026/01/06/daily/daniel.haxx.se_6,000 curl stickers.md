# 6,000 curl stickers

[January 6, 2026](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/06/6000-curl-stickers/) [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/author/daniel/) [Leave a comment](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2026/01/06/6000-curl-stickers/#respond)

I am heading to FOSDEM again at the end of January. I go there every year and I have learned that there is a really sticker-happy audience there. The last few times I have been there, I have given away several thousands of curl stickers.

As I realized I did not actually have a few thousand stickers left, I had to restock. I consider stickers a fun and somewhat easy way to market the curl project. It helps us getting known and seen out there in the world.

The stickers are paid for by [curl donations](https://opencollective.com/curl). Thanks to all of you who have donated!

This time I ordered the stickers from [stickerapp.se](https://stickerapp.se/). They have a rather fancy web UI editor and tools to make sure the stickers become exactly the way I want them. I believe the total order price was actually slightly cheaper than the previous provider I used.

I ordered five classic curl sticker designs and I introduced a new one. Here is the full set:

Six different curl stickers

**Die cut curl logo 7.5cm x 2.8cm** – the classic “small” curl logo sticker. (bottom left in the photo)

**Die cut curl logo 10cm x 3.7cm** – the slightly larger curl logo sticker. (top row in the photo)

**Rounded rectangle 7.5cm x 4.1cm** – *yes we curl*, the curl symbol and my face (mid left in the photo)

**Oval 7.5cm x 4cm** – with the curl logo (bottom right in the photo)

**Round 2.5cm x 2.5 cm** – small curl symbol. (in the middle of the photo). My favorite. Perfect for the backside of a phone. Fits *perfectly* in the logo on the lid of a Frame Work laptop.

**Round 4cm x 4cm** – curl symbol in a slightly larger round version. The new sticker variant in the set. (on the right side in the middle row in the photo)

The quality and feel of the products are next to identical to previous sticker orders. They look great!

I got 1,000 copies of each variant this time.

## The logo

The official curl logo, the curl symbol, the colors and everything related is freely available and anyone is welcome to print their own stickers at will: <https://curl.se/logo/>

## How to get one?

I bring curl stickers to all events I go to. Ask me!

There is no way to buy stickers from me or from the curl project. I encourage you to **look me up and ask** for one or a few. At FOSDEM I try to make sure the wolfSSL stand has plenty to hand out, since it is a fixed geographical point that might be easier to find than me.
