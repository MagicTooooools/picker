## A Cyberattack Was Part of the US Assault on Venezuela

We don’t have many [details](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-cyber-operation-maduro-00709816):

> President Donald Trump suggested Saturday that the U.S. used cyberattacks or other technical capabilities to cut power off in Caracas during strikes on the Venezuelan capital that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
>
> If true, it would mark one of the most public uses of U.S. cyber power against another nation in recent memory. These operations are typically highly classified, and the U.S. is considered one of the most advanced nations in cyberspace operations globally.

It might very well be true but, with all due respect, I wouldn’t trust President Donald Trump if he said that the sun was rising on the East.

@Vesselin Bontchev

I don’t believe current POTUS would ever say “that the sun was rising on the East.”

Here it is important to read THIS :

Nothing is the same any more. And Medvedev is right.

Which is why infrastructure should NOT, under any circimstances, be online.

mark, your comment isn’t valid. Natanz computers wasn’t online (Stuxnet).

Clive Robinson here often tells that his computers are offline and secure.
I’m more than sure that considering his history and background, British
GCHQ has long ago backdoored his computers while he was in hospital.
And how you exfiltrate a data? Blink a keyboard LED and record that via a
window, just one example to you.

It also seems comms where jammed during the kidnap operation. Heard some people mentioning the use of [1] Boeing EA-18G Growler . I’ve never heard about this beasts. One of the jamming pods is the [2] ALQ-99 capable of jamming 64 MHz up to 20 GHz. This makes me wonder if we the best way to “resist” such attacks is diving in deep the shortwave spectrum. I guess it’s more difficult to jam that part of the spectrum due to the wavelength and thus the big antennas requirements.

Venezuelans were training ISLAMIC TERRORISTS and sending them back ready to destroy the Israelis. That is just one part of the problem here!
It had to be stopped.

In 1deh0, mus11ms are running two websites, ba1kand0wn10ad dot org and
53rb1anf0rum dot org WHILE BEING EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT; Police, COunty, Courts, Corrections.
A decent person tried to report them and him and his entire family got
destroyed. AN ATTEMPTED MURDER WAS COVERED UP AND HE WAS TURNED INTO A FELON.

Somebody needs to stop this, this is out of control.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES RUNNING 1P TH3FT WEBSITES.
1deh0 is A JOKE!

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “We don’t have many details:”

No, and we don’t have any clues as such either.

Thus the OrangeUn’s comments could as I said over on the Squid page be “something or nothing” and “It all depends on if what was going on can be “tracked back” etc.”,

To save people following that link 😉

> **News: There Were BGP Anomalies During The Venezuela Blackout**

> “*When watching the situation in Venezuela unfold, the phrase “It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have” caught my attention*

> BGP is the first thing that comes to mind. It’s a protocol used by routers to determine what path data takes to get to it’s destination, it does this by exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems. It is also notoriously insecure and much of the data about BGP is collected in public datasets.““

<https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/>

However BGP anomalies have been logged in public data bases (unavoidable when playing with BGP not only because of the way it works, but also the way it is used).

Have a read of the Low Orbit article and make your own...
