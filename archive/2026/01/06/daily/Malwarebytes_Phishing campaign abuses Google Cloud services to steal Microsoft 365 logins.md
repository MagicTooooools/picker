# Phishing campaign abuses Google Cloud services to steal Microsoft 365 logins

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 6, 2026

![Google Cloud logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Google_Cloud_logo.png?w=1200)

Attackers are sending very convincing fake “Google” emails that slip past spam filters, route victims through several trusted Google-owned services, and ultimately lead to a look-alike Microsoft 365 sign-in page designed to harvest usernames and passwords.

[Researchers](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/phishing-campaign-leverages-trusted-google-cloud-automation-capabilities-to-evade-detection/) found that cybercriminals used [Google Cloud Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration)’s Send Email feature to send phishing emails from a legitimate Google address: `noreply-application-integration@google[.]com`.

Google Cloud Application Integration allows users to automate business processes by connecting any application with point-and-click configurations. New customers currently receive free credits, which lowers the barrier to entry and may attract some cybercriminals.

The initial email arrives from what looks like a real Google address and references something routine and familiar, such as a voicemail notification, a task to complete, or permissions to access a document. The email includes a link that points to a genuine Google Cloud Storage URL, so the web address appears to belong to Google and doesn’t look like an obvious fake.

After the first click, you are redirected to another Google‑related domain (`googleusercontent[.]com`) showing a CAPTCHA or image check. Once you pass the “I’m not a robot check,” you land on what looks like a normal Microsoft 365 sign‑in page, but on close inspection, the web address is not an official Microsoft domain.

Any credentials provided on this site will be captured by the attackers.

The use of Google infrastructure provides the phishers with a higher level of trust from both email filters and the receiving users. This is not a vulnerability, just an abuse of cloud-based services that Google provides.

## Google’s response

Google said it has taken action against the activity:

> “We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration. Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google’s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.”

We’ve seen several phishing campaigns that abuse trusted workflows from companies like Google, [PayPal](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/paypal-closes-loophole-that-let-scammers-send-real-emails-with-fake-purchase-notices), [DocuSign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/paypal-scam-abuses-docusign-api-to-spread-phishy-emails), and other cloud-based service providers to lend credibility to phishing emails and redirect targets to their credential-harvesting websites.

## How to stay safe

Campaigns like these show that some responsibility for spotting phishing emails still rests with the recipient. Besides staying informed, here are some other tips you can follow to stay safe.

* **Always check the actual web address** of any login page; if it’s not a genuine Microsoft domain, do not ...
