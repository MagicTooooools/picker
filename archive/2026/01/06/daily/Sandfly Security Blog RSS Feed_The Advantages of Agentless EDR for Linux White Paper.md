# The Advantages of Agentless EDR for Linux White Paper

06 January 2026

White Paper

As the leading provider of agentless Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for Linux, Sandfly is often asked about how our product compares against traditional endpoint agents. We have a lot of real-world experience in this area and put down the core advantages in this white paper:

[Advantages of Agentless EDR for Linux](https://sandflysecurity.com/sharing/sandfly-advantages-of-agentless-linux-edr.pdf)

This white paper goes over the top 10 advantages of agentless security for Linux below:

1. Low Risk of Kernel Panics
2. Universal Compatibility Across Linux Architectures
3. Minimal Performance Overhead
4. Kernel Update Conflict Risk
5. Instant, Zero-Friction Deployment
6. Evasion Resistance
7. Superior Detection of Stealthy, Post-Compromise Threats
8. Incident Response and Integrity Validation
9. Seamless Support of Varied Linux Architectures
10. Dramatically Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Agent-based systems have their place (and Sandfly works alongside them). However, the disadvantages can be significant and lead to massive blind spots in enterprise Linux protection where they can't be deployed.

Read our white paper above, then [contact Sandfly today](https://sandflysecurity.com/contact-us) with any questions and we will give you a live demo to show you how fast, safe, and effective agentless security for Linux is.
