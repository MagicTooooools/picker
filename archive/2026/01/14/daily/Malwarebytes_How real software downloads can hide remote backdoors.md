# How real software downloads can hide remote backdoors

by [Stefan Dasic](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/sdasic) |
January 14, 2026

![Camouflage](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/camouflage.jpg?w=1200)

It starts with a simple search.

You need to set up remote access to a colleague’s computer. You do a Google search for “RustDesk download,” click one of the top results, and land on a polished website with documentation, downloads, and familiar branding.

You install the software, launch it, and everything works exactly as expected.

What you don’t see is the second program that installs alongside it—one that quietly gives attackers persistent access to your computer.

That’s exactly what we observed in a campaign using the fake domain **rustdesk[.]work**.

## The bait: a near-perfect impersonation

We identified a malicious website at **rustdesk[.]work** impersonating the legitimate RustDesk project, which is hosted at **rustdesk.com**. The fake site closely mirrors the real one, complete with multilingual content and prominent warnings claiming (ironically) that rustdesk[.]work is the *only* *official domain*.

This campaign doesn’t exploit software vulnerabilities or rely on advanced [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) techniques. It succeeds entirely through deception. When a website looks legitimate and the software behaves normally, most users never suspect anything is wrong.

![The fake site in Chinese](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2026-01-12-10.56.01-rustdesk.work-5d6de5b4f19c.png?w=1024)![The fake site in English](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2026-01-12-10.55.40-rustdesk-work.translate.goog-a9718327f2e5.png?w=1024)

## What happens when you run the installer

The installer performs a deliberate bait-and-switch:

1. It installs **real RustDesk**, fully functional and unmodified
2. It quietly installs **a hidden [backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor)**, a [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) framework known as **Winos4.0**

The user sees RustDesk launch normally. Everything appears to work. Meanwhile, the backdoor quietly establishes a connection to the attacker’s server.

By bundling malware with working software, attackers remove the most obvious red flag: broken or missing functionality. From the user’s point of view, nothing feels wrong.

## Inside the infection chain

The malware executes through a staged process, with each step designed to evade detection and establish persistence:

![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Rust-software-code.png)

**Stage 1: The trojanized installer**

The downloaded file (`rustdesk-1.4.4-x86_64.exe`) acts as both **dropper and decoy**. It writes two files to disk:

* The legitimate RustDesk installer, which is executed to maintain cover
* `logger.exe`, the Winos4.0 payload

The malware hides in plain sight. While the user watches RustDesk install normally, the malicious payload is quietly staged in the background.

**Stage 2: Loader execution**

The `logger.exe` file is a loader — its job is to set up the environment for the main implant. During execution, it:

* Creates a new process
* Allocates executable memory
* Transitions execution to a new runtime identity: `Libserver.exe`

This loader-to-implant handoff is a common technique in sophisticated malware to separate the initial dropper from the persistent backdoor.
