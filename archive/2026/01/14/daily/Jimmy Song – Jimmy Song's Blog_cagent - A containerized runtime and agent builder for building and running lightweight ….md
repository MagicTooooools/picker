## Detailed Introduction

cagent is a containerized agent builder and runtime developed by Docker engineering to streamline the workflow from building to deploying lightweight AI agents. It provides an extensible daemon and toolchain that support containerized deployment, resource isolation, and telemetry, making it easier to run agents in cloud-native and edge environments with observability.

## Main Features

* A unified agent builder and runtime that supports container images and local debugging.
* Native container resource isolation and scheduling support with compatibility for Kubernetes deployment patterns.
* Built-in telemetry and monitoring interfaces to integrate with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Use Cases

Suitable for hosting autonomous tasks, data collectors, or lightweight agents in cloud-native or edge environments. Teams can use cagent to rapidly build, iterate, and deploy agent services while maintaining stable operation, resource isolation, and performance observability.

## Technical Features

Implemented in Go with an emphasis on low overhead and extensibility. cagent adopts containerization and daemon patterns, integrates with existing CI/CD and monitoring ecosystems (such as Prometheus), and is designed for production orchestration and operations.
