# Brushstrokes and breaches with Terryn Valikodath

[Humans of Talos](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/humans-of-talos/)

Cisco Talos is kicking off the new year with a behind-the-scenes look at incident response through the eyes of Terryn Valikodath, Senior Incident Response Consultant at Talos. In this episode, Amy sits down with Terryn to explore the realities of a job that blends technical know-how with communication skills, proactive planning, and a passion for problem-solving. Terryn’s path to cybersecurity started with a fascination for criminal forensics and a knack for jailbreaking his family's tech — interests that eventually steered him toward the fast-paced world of digital investigations.

Join us as Terryn shares what keeps him motivated during high-pressure incidents, the satisfaction he finds in teaching others during cyber range trainings, and the creative outlets that help him recharge.

**Amy Ciminnisi: Can you tell us a little bit about what you do here in Talos?**

Terryn Valikodath: Absolutely. I’m a Senior Incident Response Consultant, so essentially an incident responder. The unique thing about our team is that we handle both proactive and reactive work. On the proactive side, we help develop incident response plans, run tabletop exercises, threat hunts, training, and similar tasks. On the reactive side, we step in when an organization experiences a security event, investigate, and provide recommendations to get them back up and running. It’s rewarding to see both sides of the work.

**AC: On my end, I'm always amazed at all the different services Cisco Talos Incident Response provides. Is it difficult to balance them, and is there a part of the job you enjoy most?**

TV: It definitely takes some getting used to since most cybersecurity roles focus on either proactive or reactive tasks, not both. But it’s helpful, because our direct experience informs the advice we give. For example, when we develop an incident response plan, we can reference real situations we’ve handled. That builds trust with customers. My favorite aspect is running cyber range trainings — a three-day course where we teach technical folks how to handle incident response. I’m passionate about teaching, both externally and within our team. I enjoy demystifying the field and showing people that it’s about dedication and learning, not just being a specialist.
