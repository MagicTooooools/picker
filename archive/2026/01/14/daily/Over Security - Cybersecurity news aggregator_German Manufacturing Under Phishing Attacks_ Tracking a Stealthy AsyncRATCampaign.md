German Manufacturing Under Phishing Attacks: Tracking a Stealthy AsyncRAT Campaign

Manufacturing [companies](https://any.run/enterprise/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=german-manufacture-attack&utm_term=140126&utm_content=linktoenterprise) have quietly become one of the most hunted species in the modern threat landscape. Not because they are careless, but because they are operationally critical, geographically distributed, and often rely on complex IT and OT environments that attackers love to probe.

## Key Takeaways

* Manufacturing is among the top industries targeted by ransomware groups and advanced campaigns, often with region-specific lures.

* Attackers continue to favor invoice-themed and supplier-related emails, carefully localized to increase trust and click-through rates in manufacturing environments.

* Files detected by only one or two vendors often indicate fresh attacks designed to bypass traditional defenses, making early discovery critical.

* The reuse of [WebDAV](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/client-side-exploitation/), known vulnerabilities, and familiar [RAT families](https://any.run/malware-trends/rat) across cases helps analysts distinguish structured campaigns from background noise.

* Filtering threats by sector and country dramatically improves relevance, allowing teams to focus on attacks that are most likely to impact their business.

* By identifying campaigns before alerts trigger, organizations can shorten dwell time and prevent disruptions that are especially costly for manufacturing operations.

* By correlating industry, geography, techniques, and indicators, [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=german-manufacture-attack&utm_term=140126&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) helps manufacturing companies uncover active campaigns early and turn threat intelligence into a preventive control, not just a reference source.

## The Threat Landscape: Manufacturing Under Siege

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=german-manufacture-attack&utm_term=140126&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s data, based on sandbox submissions of over 500K analysts and 15K SOCs, shows increased malicious activity against manufacturing companies. While this uptick aligns with patterns across other industries, manufacturing consistently shows slightly higher-than-average attack rates, confirming its status as a priority target.
