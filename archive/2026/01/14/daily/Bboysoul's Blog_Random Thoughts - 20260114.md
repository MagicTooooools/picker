### Introduction

Welcome to follow my channel, where I occasionally share random messages

<https://t.me/bboyapp>

Or follow me on Twitter

<https://twitter.com/bboysoulcn>

1. ### My Home Fibre Network Disintegrated, Literally

The author used so-called “military-grade” armored fiber optic cable at home, which literally disintegrated three years after being buried underground when moved. The cable jacket crumbled like cookie crumbs, recounting this home network disaster and its rescue process, a textbook example of home lab lessons learned the hard way.

2. ### The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe

The excessive corner radius in macOS Tahoe makes resizing windows extremely difficult, as most of the clickable area is located outside the window. Users instinctively try to grab the corners inside the window but cannot resize, making this counter-intuitive design exceptionally frustrating for window adjustment.

3. ### Hypermind

Hypermind is a fully decentralized P2P deployment counter and ephemeral chat platform, a useless but interesting “high availability solution” built on Hyperswarm DHT technology. It lets you see how many people worldwide are also running this 50MB memory container and enables brief, traceless conversations with them.

4. ### My HomeLab Setup in 2026

The author provides a detailed introduction to their 2026 home lab configuration, using a 10-inch mini rack integrating OPNsense router, TrueNAS storage, Proxmox virtualization platform, and other devices. Running HomeAssistant, Forgejo, PeerTube, and various other self-hosted applications, showcasing a compact and efficient modern home network architecture.

5. ### The passwords I actually memorise

The author shares eight passwords worth memorizing (computer login, password manager master password, phone password, email, remote backup, MFA recovery, Apple account, and bank verification word), and explains in detail the recovery strategy for rebuilding digital life through these memorized passwords in the event of a complete loss of all devices.

6. ### Authentication: who are you? Proofs are passwords, codes and keys

A comprehensive and in-depth explanation of core authentication concepts, from passwords, verification codes, keys to multi-factor authentication, session tokens, API keys, and delegated authentication. Systematically explains the working principles, security features, and implementation details of various authentication methods, serving as a complete guide to understanding modern authentication mechanisms.

7. ### Primer on HTTP Security Headers

A detailed introduction to the function and configuration methods of HTTP security response headers, including X-Frame-Options, HSTS, CSP, Cookie security attributes, CORS, cache control, and other key security mechanisms. Helps developers understand how to defend against clickjacking, XSS, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other common web security threats through proper HTTP header configuration.

8. ### 2026 is the Year of Self-hosting

The author believes 2026 is the year of self-hosting, as the combination of cheap high-performance mini PCs, Tailscale private networks, and Claude Code AI assistants enables ordinary tech enthusiasts to easily set up and maintain their own password managers, photo storage, media servers, and other self-hosted services without needing to become system administrators.

9. ### Floppy Disks: the best TV remote for kids

The author created a TV remote control based on a real floppy disk drive for their 3-year-old son. The child can play different videos or music by inserting different floppy disks, giving them autonomy and control through physical interaction while experiencing the mechanical beauty and authentic sounds of this extinct storage medium.

10. ### crt.sh - Certificate Search

crt.sh is a free SSL/TLS certificate search and transparency log query tool provided by Sectigo. You can query all publicly issued certificate records by domain name, organization name, or certificate fingerprint, making it very useful for security research, domain monitoring, and certificate management.
