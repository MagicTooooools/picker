# Ugandan officials turn off internet on eve of national elections

Authorities in Uganda have imposed an internet blackout and suspended some mobile phone services on the eve of a general election scheduled for Thursday.

The Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) started turning off internet and mobile phone services on Tuesday, [according to](https://x.com/UCC_Official/status/2011409612176507095) the agency.

Internet monitoring firm Netblocks [confirmed](https://mastodon.social/%40netblocks/115892400097081262) a “widespread internet shutdown” on Wednesday.

“This indefinite internet shutdown is a brazen attack on the right to freedom of expression which includes access to information,” Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s East and Southern Africa Regional Director, said in a [statement](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/01/uganda-internet-shutdown/).

“It is especially alarming coming as it does just before a crucial election already marred by massive repression and an unprecedented crackdown on opposition parties and dissenting voices.”

Chagutah called the fact that no end date has been given for when the blackout will lift “ominous.”

United Nations Human Rights also condemned the action, [saying on X](https://x.com/UNHumanRights/status/2011436800292573693) that “open access to communication & information is key to free & genuine elections.”

In addition to suspending internet and mobile phone services, authorities have halted the sale of new sim or phone cards and cut off outbound data roaming services, Amnesty said in a [press release](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/01/uganda-internet-shutdown/).

The internet blackout comes against the backdrop of a race to unseat Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is seeking a seventh term and has stayed in office since 1986 by eliminating term limits and prosecuting rivals.

Opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is running against Museveni and is riding a wave of popular support.

“All those in Uganda, who are able to bypass the criminal regime's internet blockade - big up yourselves!” Wine [said on X](https://x.com/HEBobiwine/status/2011335930540392502) Wednesday. “Pass around the message. Let everyone know how to do it. They cut off the internet in order to hide rigging and atrocities. Record everything and share with the world.”

Beginning in August, Ugandan authorities froze bank accounts belonging to at least six non-government organizations in a bid to keep Musevini in control.

The UCC has said the blackout is needed to stop misinformation from spreading and prevent electoral fraud.

During elections in 2021 Ugandan authorities imposed a week-long internet blackout. Dozens of people were killed at the time.
