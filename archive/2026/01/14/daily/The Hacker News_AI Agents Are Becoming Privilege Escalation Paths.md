AI agents have quickly moved from experimental tools to core components of daily workflows across security, engineering, IT, and operations. What began as individual productivity aids, like personal [code assistants](https://wing.security/ai-code-assistants/), chatbots, and copilots, has evolved into shared, organization-wide agents embedded in critical processes. These agents can orchestrate workflows across multiple systems, for example:

* An HR Agent that provisions or deprovisions accounts across IAM, SaaS apps, VPNs, and cloud platforms based on HR system updates.
* A Change Management Agent that validates a change request, updates configuration in production systems, logs approvals in ServiceNow, and updates documentation in Confluence.
* A Customer Support Agent that retrieves customer context from CRM, checks account status in billing systems, triggers fixes in backend services, and updates the support ticket.

To deliver value at scale, organizational AI agents are designed to serve many users and roles. They are granted broader access permissions, compared to individual users, in order to access the tools and data required to operate efficiently.

The availability of these agents has unlocked real productivity gains: faster triage, reduced manual effort, and streamlined operations. But these early wins come with a hidden cost. As AI agents become more powerful and more deeply integrated, they also become access intermediaries. Their wide permissions can obscure who is actually accessing what, and under which authority. In focusing on speed and automation, many organizations are overlooking the new access risks being introduced.

## The Access Model Behind Organizational Agents

Organizational agents are typically designed to operate across many resources, serving multiple users, roles, and workflows through a single implementation. Rather than being tied to an individual user, these agents act as shared resources that can respond to requests, automate tasks, and orchestrate actions across systems on behalf of many users. This design makes agents easy to deploy and scalable across the organization.

To function seamlessly, agents rely on shared service accounts, API keys, or OAuth grants to authenticate with the systems they interact with. These credentials are often long-lived and centrally managed, allowing the agent to operate continuously without user involvement. To avoid friction and ensure the agent can handle a wide range of requests, permissions are frequently granted broadly, covering more systems, actions, and data than any single user would typically require.

While this approach maximizes convenience and coverage, these design choices can unintentionally create powerful access intermediaries that bypass traditional permission boundaries.

## Breaking the Traditional Access Control Model

Organizational agents often operate with permissions far broader than those granted to individual users, enabling them to span multiple systems and workflows. When users interact with these agents, they no longer access systems directly; instead, they issue requests that the agent executes on their behalf. Those actions run under the agent's identity, not the user's. This breaks traditional access control models, where permissions are enforced at the user level. A user with limited access can indirectly trigger actions or retrieve data they would not be authorized to access directly, simply by going through the agent. Because logs and audit trails attribute activity to the agent, not the requester, this privilege escalation can occur without clear visibility, accountability, or policy enforcement.

## Organizational Agents Can Quietly Bypass Access Controls

The risks of agent-driven privilege escalation often surface in subtle, everyday workflows rather than overt abuse. For example, a user with limited access to financial systems may interact with an organizational AI agent to "summarize customer performance." The agent, operating with broader permissions, pulls data from billing, CRM, and finance platforms, returning insights that the user would not be authorized to view directly.

In another scenario, an engineer without production access asks an AI agent to "fix a deployment issue." The agent investigates logs, modifies configuration in a production environment, and triggers a pipeline restart using its own elevated credentials. The user never touched production systems, yet production was changed on their behalf.

In both cases, no explicit policy is violated. The agent is authorized, the request appears legitimate, and existing IAM controls are technically enforced. However, access controls are effectively bypassed because authorization is evaluated at the agent level, not the user level, creating unintended and often invisible privilege escalation.

## The Limits of Traditional Access Controls in the Age of AI Agents

Traditional security controls are built around human users and direct system access, which makes them poorly suited for agent-mediated workflows. IAM systems enforce permissions based on who the user is, but when actions are executed by an AI agent, authorization is evaluated against the agent's identity, not the requester's. As a result, user-level restrictions no longer apply. Logging and audit trails compound the problem by attributing activity to the agent's identity, masking who initiated the action and why. With agents, security teams have lost the ability to enforce least p...
