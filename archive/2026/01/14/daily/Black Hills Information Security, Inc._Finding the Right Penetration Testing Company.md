This blog is for anyone who is interested in finding a good penetration testing company. Those on the “sales” team may also find common ground below.

It’s been an exciting 17 years here at BHIS, and I’ve seen several industry trends come and go. As a whole, I feel the field has gained respect and understanding as penetration testers evolved from being viewed as “smelly, deviant hackers” to more “professional, trusted partners.” In the past, we frequently needed meetings with C-Suite executives explaining what we do in order to separate the stigma away from *hacking* to *security*—we even had a whole slide deck just for this purpose. It’s now been years since we’ve had to jump on a call with senior leadership to smooth over tensions surrounding proposed work.

Since 2008, I’ve been on the receiving (sales) end of BHIS, and I’ve often wanted to share tips to potential clients for the best way to get a fast, accurate quote at the best price. So as we move into 2026, I’ve written down some of my biggest insights on how to gather bids, determine the quality of testing firms, and get the best pricing for your engagement.

Please note that is not an exhaustive list but a focus on the biggest pain points that I often see with potential clients.

## Bidding/Gaining Quotes

Our typical bidding process at BHIS includes an initial call for new customers, with a formal quote provided by week’s end, if not same-day. Unusual or non-standard environments may require a consultation with one of our testers, which may add a week or so. Other companies may provide different expectations, so clearly outline the timeframe of your internal decision process so that all can respond in a timely fashion.

* **Start early** for RFP processes. If you need to go through a formal or rigorous Request-for-Proposal (RFP) process, consider scheduling a call to clarify your needs. I can’t express the difference it makes to know that you’re willing to talk through scope within an RFP, as well as give our team enough time to jump through the extra hoops. If your RFP is “blind reviewed” where we can’t talk and is to be submitted on a portal… well, my heart just breaks.
* **Work through legal** right away. Begin Master Service Agreement (MSA) reviews early as revisions can be extensive. If your legal process is typically backed up, just know that this will slow things down. We can start working the MSA from your paper but will need time to add our essentials to your document.
* **Allow adequate time** for larger scopes. A larger scope of work will take more testers, time, and planning, so allow for more time to find a vendor.
* **Minimize excessive paperwork.** Don’t be overbearing with several security Q/A over multiple tabs. If a penetration testing company has a SOC 2 Type II and an annual Letter of Attestation for a penetration test from a 3rd party, they’ve done their due diligence. You may not always be able to bypass this process (especially in very large corporations), but you may also find yourself with fewer bidders at higher prices when requiring these added stipulations.

## Evaluating Quality

* **Align internal expectations** before beginning vendor calls. Determine the difference between management’s concerns vs technical resource concerns and try to get on the same page for a unified goal. It’s always troubling when one team wants to “prove” something to another, or when we get on a Rules of Engagement call with a technical team who are clueless about what management hired us to do. Please don’t put a testing firm in the middle of your internal politics
* **Compare bids accurately—**Are you comparing apples to apples? Ask for hourly rate, bottom line, and the days...
