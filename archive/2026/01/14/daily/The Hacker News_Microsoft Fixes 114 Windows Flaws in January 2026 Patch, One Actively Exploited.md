Microsoft on Tuesday rolled out its [first security update for 2026](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2026-Jan), addressing 114 security flaws, including one vulnerability that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.

Of the 114 flaws, eight are rated Critical, and 106 are rated Important in severity. As many as 58 vulnerabilities have been classified as privilege escalation, followed by 22 information disclosure, 21 remote code execution, and five spoofing flaws. According to data collected by Fortra, the update marks the third-largest January Patch Tuesday after January 2025 and January 2022.

These patches are in addition to [two security flaws](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security) that Microsoft has addressed in its Edge browser since the release of the [December 2025 Patch Tuesday](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/microsoft-issues-security-fixes-for-56.html) update, including a spoofing flaw in its Android app ([CVE-2025-65046](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-65046), 3.1) and a case of insufficient policy enforcement in Chromium's WebView tag ([CVE-2026-0628](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2026-0628), CVSS score: 8.8).

The vulnerability that has come under in-the-wild exploitation is [CVE-2026-20805](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2026-20805) (CVSS score: 5.5), an information disclosure flaw impacting Desktop Window Manager. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MTIC) and Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have been credited with identifying and reporting the flaw.

"Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor in Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally," Microsoft said in an advisory. "The type of information that could be disclosed if an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability is a section address from a remote ALPC port, which is user-mode memory."

There are currently no details on how the vulnerability is being exploited, the scale of such efforts, and who may be behind the activity.

"DWM is responsible for drawing everything on the display of a Windows system, which means it offers an enticing combination of privileged access and universal availability, since just about any process might need to display something," Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said in a statement. "In this case, exploitation leads to improper disclosure of an ALPC port section address, which is a section of user-mode memory where Windows components coordinate various actions between themselves."

Microsoft previously addressed an actively exploited zero-day flaw in DWM in May 2024 ([CVE-2024-30051](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-patches-61-flaws-including.html), CVSS score: 7.8), which was described as a privilege escalation flaw that was abused by multiple threat actors, in connection with the distribution of QakBot and other malware families. Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, called DWM a "frequent flyer" on Patch Tuesday, with 20 CVEs patched in the library since 2022.

Jack Bicer, director of vulnerability research at Action1, [said](https://www.action1.com/patch-tuesday/patch-tuesday-january-2026/) the vulnerability can be exploited by a locally authenticated attacker to disclose information, defeat address space layout randomization (ASLR), and other defenses.

"Vulnerabilities of this nature are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits," Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, told The Hacker News.

"By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack."

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has since [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/01/13/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog) the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, mandating Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the latest fixes by February 3, 2026.

Another vulnerability of note concerns a security feature bypass impacting Secure Boot Certificate Expiration ([CVE-2026-21265](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2026-21265), CVSS score: 6.4) that could allow an attacker to undermine a crucial security mechanism that ensures that firmware modules come from a trusted source and prevent malware from being run during the boot process.

In November 2025, Microsoft [announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/secure-boot-playbook-for-certificates-expiring-in-2026/4469235) that it will be expiring three Windows Secure Boot certificates issued in 2011, effective June 2026, urging customers to [update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/windows-secure-boot-certificate-expiration-and-ca-updates-7ff40d33-95dc-4c3c-8725-a9b95457578e) to their 2023 counterparts -
