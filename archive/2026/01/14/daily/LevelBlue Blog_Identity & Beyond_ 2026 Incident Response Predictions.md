Rather than relying on technical exploits, threat actors are prioritizing legitimate access, persistence, and operational efficiency, enabling them to evade users, security controls, and automated detection.

Over the last 12 months, we saw phishing and social engineering as the initial intrusion vector for 40% of all our cases worldwide, more than double the next two most popular vectors, credential abuse and CVE exploitation. Despite massive advancements in email security, attackers have been able to circumvent traditional defenses by avoiding traditional malware.

As a result, incidents will be defined less by obvious compromise indicators and more by subtle misuse of authentication flows, cloud applications, and established business workflows, challenging defenders to distinguish malicious activity from routine behavior.
