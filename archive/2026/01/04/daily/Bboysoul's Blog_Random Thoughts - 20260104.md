### Introduction

Welcome to follow my channel, where I occasionally share random messages

1. ### Encryption vs. Compression

A detailed explanation of the correct order between compression and encryption, demonstrating through actual command-line tests the significant differences between the wrong order (encrypt-then-compress) and the correct order (compress-then-encrypt), and discussing the principles of security attacks like CRIME and BREACH.

2. ### Connection Pooling for Postgres using PG Bouncer

A comprehensive introduction to PG Bouncer connection pooling principles and three pooling modes (session, transaction, statement), including local and Kubernetes deployment guides, performance testing comparisons, and analysis of the pros and cons of client-side versus database-side pooling.

3. ### The e-scooter isn’t new – London was zooming around on Autopeds a century ago

Revealing the history of electric scooters from a century ago, the Autoped entered the London market in 1917 at a price equivalent to about £1,600 today, featuring famous historical photos of Lady Florence Norman using an Autoped. It eventually exited the market in 1922 due to British weather conditions.

4. ### I’m returning my Framework 16

A detailed review of the Framework 16 laptop experience, pointing out that its €2,000 price tag doesn’t match the actual experience, covering various issues including weight, design, display, battery life, and ultimately deciding to return it and seek alternatives.

5. ### Instant database clones with PostgreSQL 18

Introducing PostgreSQL 18’s new feature file\_copy\_method=clone, which works with modern file systems (XFS/ZFS/APFS) and their reflink functionality to achieve nearly instantaneous database cloning, reducing the cloning time for a 6GB database from 67 seconds to 0.2 seconds without using additional disk space.

6. ### What’s in my HomeLab: 2026

Sharing a complete service list of a personal HomeLab in 2026, covering over 40 self-hosted services including tools (Gitea, Home Assistant, etc.), monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus), media (Jellyfin, Sonarr), all running on a €4 FreeBSD VPS.

7. ### FediMeteo: How a Tiny €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service for Thousands

The story of how a €4 per month FreeBSD VPS was used to build FediMeteo, a global weather service supporting 2,937 cities across 38 countries, with 7,707 Fediverse followers, efficiently running using FreeBSD jails, snac, and Python.

8. ### 10 years of personal finances in plain text files

Sharing 10 years of experience managing personal finances using Beancount, a plain text accounting tool, containing 45,000 lines of financial records, 10,000 transactions, and 500 documents, requiring only 30-45 minutes of maintenance per month, demonstrating the power and durability of plaintext accounting.

9. ### TCP/IP: SYN flood attack on the RTFM server, and “Hacker News hug of death”

Recording the experience of the RTFM blog simultaneously suffering from a SYN flood attack and Hacker News traffic surge, detailing the complete process of solving the problem using Linux kernel TCP tuning, iptables rules, and iptables-persistent.

10. ### JeffGeerling.com has been Migrated to Hugo

Jeff Geerling shares the decision and process of migrating his personal blog from Drupal 10 to Hugo static site generator. After 10 years of multiple upgrades from Drupal 6 to 10, he chose a simpler Markdown workflow, bidding farewell to the burden of maintaining a complex CMS.
