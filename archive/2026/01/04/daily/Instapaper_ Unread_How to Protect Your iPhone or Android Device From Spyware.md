# How to Protect Your iPhone or Android Device From Spyware

Being targeted by sophisticated spyware is relatively rare, but experts say that everyone needs to stay vigilant as this dangerous malware continues to proliferate worldwide.

In December, hundreds of [iPhone](https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/) and [Android](https://www.wired.com/story/android-16-features-release-date-how-to-download/) users received a threat notification, warning them their device had been [targeted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-sent-new-round-cyber-threat-notifications-users-84-countries-2025-12-05/) by spyware. Days later, [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2025/12/14/ios-262-update-now-waning-issued-to-all-iphone-users/) and [Google](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/google-and-apple-roll-out-emergency-security-updates-after-zero-day-attacks/) patched security holes that experts think were used to plant the stealthy malware on a select group of devices.

Spyware is so dangerous because the adversary is able to see and hear everything you do on your smartphone, including via encrypted messaging apps such as [WhatsApp](https://www.wired.com/tag/whatsapp/) and [Signal](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/). But it tends to be extremely targeted against dissidents, journalists, politicians, and business leaders operating in certain sectors.

The malware has hit a number of high-profile people, including former Amazon CEO [Jeff Bezos](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/jeff-bezos-hack-iphone.html) and [Hanan Elatr](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/hanan-elatr-phone-pegasus/), wife of murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi—who were both compromised by NSO Group’s [Pegasus spyware](https://www.wired.com/story/pegasus-spyware-war-zone-first-time/).

Today, spyware remains just as prolific in these circles, but experts think its impact could be widening. In early December, as Google issued its threat notification, the tech firm’s researchers [detailed](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/intellexa-zero-day-exploits-continue) how an exploit chain was used to install [Predator spyware](https://www.wired.com/story/us-congress-spyware/) surreptitiously onto a device.

It came after an [alert](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/24/spyware-allows-cyber-threat-actors-target-users-messaging-applications) issued by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), warning users that adversaries are “actively leveraging” commercial spyware to target mobile messaging applications.

As the risk increases, what can you do to protect your Android device or Apple iPhone?

## Zero-Click Attacks

Spyware often hits smartphones in so-called [zero-click](https://www.wired.com/story/synology-zero-click-vulnerability/) attacks, meaning your phone can become infected without clicking a link, downloading a malicious image, or any other kind of user interaction.

The attack cannot be mitigated via the usual routes. If the malware has infected your smartphone, adversaries can “read messages, observe keystrokes, take screenshots, monitor notifications, and access banking apps,” according to Pieter Arntz, a senior malware researcher at security firm Malwarebytes.

With full system access, spyware can “exfiltrate data such as emails and texts, send messages, steal credentials, and log in to cloud systems,” says Rocky Cole, cofounder of iVerify, an app that helps users to [detect spyware](https://www.wired.com/story/iverify-spyware-detection-tool-nso-group-pegasus/).

Aside from zero-click attacks, spyware can infect a device when someone clicks on a compromised link sent over text, email, or social media. Meanwhile, the malware can hide in malicious apps that appear to be legit. It can also be concealed in an image file and downloaded via a message, or get onto your smartphone due to vulnerabilities in your browser.

Infection usually starts through malicious links and fake apps, but it is also taking place via “more subtle methods,” says Richard LaTulip, a field CISO at security company Recorded Future, which [collaborated](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/intellexas-global-corporate-web) with Google’s threat intelligence team on the Predator spyware findings.

LaTulip cites the example of recent research on [malicious browser extensions](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/chrome_edge_malicious_browser_extensions/) affecting millions of users that shows “how seemingly harmless tools can become surveillance devices.”

These techniques, often developed by nation-state adversaries linked to governments, indicate a trend toward “more covert, persistent, and device-level compromises,” he says.

## A Bigger Problem

Over the past few years, spyware has become a growing issue. Governments and the companies that make the malware say the surveillance tools are used to target only criminals and terrorists, or for national security purposes.

“But the truth is that human rights activists, journalists, and many others across the world have been unlawfully targeted with spyware,” Rebecca White, Amnesty International’s researcher on [targeted surveillance](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2025/12/intellexa-leaks-predator-spyware-operations-exposed/), tells WIRED. “In this way, spyware can be used as a tool of repression—to silence people speaking truth to power.”

Thai activist Niraphorn Onnkhaow is a prime example. Between 2020 and 2021, at the height of Thailand’s pro-democracy protests, Onnkhaow was [targeted](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/thailand-state-backed-digital-abuse-used-silence-women-and-lgbti-activists-new) 14 times by Pegasus spyware. Soon afterward, she decided to end her role in the protest movement amid fears that her private data could be weaponized against her.

“Data can be weaponized and lead to more abuse, online and offline—especially for people who already face discrimination based on their identity; for example, on the basis of gender or race,” White says.

Beyond activists, mobile spyware appears to be targeting a wider subset of people, often within a business environment. The malware is hitting “a wide range of society,” from government officials to financial IT ...
