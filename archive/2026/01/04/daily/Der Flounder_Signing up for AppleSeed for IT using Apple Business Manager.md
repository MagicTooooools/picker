Apple’s [AppleSeed for IT program](https://beta.apple.com/for-it) is designed to help enterprise and education customers test beta versions of Apple’s software.

[![](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screenshot-2026-01-04-at-1.56.10-pm.png?w=595)](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screenshot-2026-01-04-at-1.56.10-pm.png)

To assist with making it easier to test these beta versions on devices, it’s possible for a user with the [Administrator](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/intro-to-roles-and-privileges-axm97dd59159/web) role in [Apple Business Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/welcome/web) or [Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/welcome/web) to accept the [AppleSeed program’s terms and conditions on behalf of their organization](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/test-software-updates-appleseed-beta-program-depe8583cf10/web). In turn, this will enable devices to be enrolled in Apple’s beta programs without the need for the user to sign in with an Apple Account on the device. For more details on how to do this, please see below the jump.

**Pre-requisites:**

* Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager instance for your organization
* Managed Apple Account with the [Administrator](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/intro-to-roles-and-privileges-axm97dd59159/web) role for that Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager instance

1. Sign into the Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager instance via a web browser using a managed Apple Account with the [Administrator](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/welcome/web) role.
2. At the bottom left corner of the browser, click on the menu and select **Preferences**.

3. Select **Beta Features**.

5. At the **Agreement** window, read through the **Apple Beta Software Program Agreement** agreement.

8. At the **Agreement** window, read through the **AppleSeed for IT** agreement.
9. Once you’ve read through the agreement, click the **Agree** button.

Once you’ve agreed to the **AppleSeed for IT** agreement, you should now be signed into the [AppleSeed for IT website](https://beta.apple.com/for-it).

With this program signup completed, you should now be able to enroll devices in an Apple beta program using a token. The token-based enrollment method removes the need to sign into the device using an Apple Account. For more details on how to do this, please see the link below:
