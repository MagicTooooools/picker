Twenty years ago, I started publishing articles and essays here, and I recently published the [500th post](https://adamcaudill.com/2026/01/02/five-hundred/) to this site. After writing **267,897** words here and investing **2,100** hours into this site, I’ve learned a few things, made some mistakes, and I’d like to share some of these insights with you. Whether you are a veteran of the blogosphere or questioning if you should dip your toes in the waters (you should), I think you will find some useful information here.

This isn’t a how-to, this isn’t a collection of best practices, and this certainly isn’t a “how to get rich as a blogger” guide. This is what I’ve learned from making mistakes over the last 20+ years, and how you can avoid them, or maybe this will help you see that you’ve been making the same mistake.

I hope that you will find this to be helpful. Also, there’s no narrative arc, so feel free to jump around and focus on the sections that are most interesting to you.

## Tools Matter [#](#tools-matter)

The tools you use to collect ideas, draft posts, and systems used to publish your writing are far more important than they may seem at first. This isn’t just a matter of fighting bad tools, but because each tool or system used has a tendency to add a bit of friction to the process, and the greater the friction, the less you will write over time.

This friction builds up over time, compounding, and eventually thwarts the desire to actually write.

### Minimise Friction [#](#minimise-friction)

Whether you are using a (self-)hosted platform or a static generator, pick a framework that doesn’t get in your way. Pick something that allows you to write with the smallest number of annoyances and extra steps.

A great example of this is [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), it’s clean and simple. Or [write.as](https://write.as/), which has a beautiful focus on simplicity & elegance. Or any of a dozen other options.

While it’s important to look at the features, to ensure it’ll do what you need, it’s more important to choose an option that stays out of your way. Don’t compromise on ease of use for any other feature, as nothing else matters if you eventually lose interest in writing.

### Dynamic vs. Static [#](#dynamic-vs-static)

There are two types of publishing frameworks, those that dynamically generate the pages on the server, such as Ghost or WordPress, and static generators that build the files needed, and can be served without any code running on the server.

These static generators shift all the work to your computer over the server, allowing the site you publish to be more secure, incredibly fast, and opens the door to far more (and cheaper) hosting options. The tradeoff is that adding content is more time consuming and complex.

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), as with Hugo, the added complexity is low enough that the tradeoffs are worth it. There are a [huge number](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators) of options for static generators, each with a different set of tradeoffs.

### Tools are Temporary. Data is Forever [#](#tools-are-temporary-data-is-forever)

It’s critical to carefully select the tools you use, and re-evaluate these from time to time, ensuring that they are actually serving your workflow well. If your tools aren’t working, *throw them out*. While moving data and overhauling workflows may be a temporary inconvenience, that pain won’t last as long as using the wrong tools.

Thankfully, nearly all blogging platforms offer export & import systems, making it a straightforward process to move between platforms. While this isn’t always as easy as one would like, the important thing is that the option is there. It’s important that you aren’t forced into a single platform.

One important thing to remember if you look at changing platforms, make sure you pay attention to anything that could break links. From the URL structure for your posts, to the location of your RSS feed, make sure that you either match these after the move, or add redirects to ensure that nothing breaks.

### Own Your Name [#](#own-your-name)

No matter what you use, make sure that you are using a domain name that you own. This isn’t just for branding, it’s to ensure that you always have the freedom to switch platforms, tools, underlying technologies, you name it. This way you always have options.

While this does add some cost, it also ensures that you aren’t beholden to any single company. If they make a change you don’t like, just move your site.

### My Tool Stack [#](#my-tool-stack)

As noted above, this site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), though it didn’t start there. Originally, back in 2006, this site used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), then moved to Octopress, then to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), then back to WordPress, and then, in 2021, to Hugo.

For writing, most posts start in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), a great app for iOS and macOS, that has fantastic markdown support and using iCloud to sync between devices. I will typically use this to capture the first notes of an idea, and then work on the prose on and off, sometimes over years. This is one of my favourite parts of my workflow, it’s fantastic.

Once a piece is ready for serious focus, I then move to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), one of the best dedicated writings apps I’ve used. This is where the real work happens, and it has a feature set that’s ideal for actually getting that work done.

If I need to share an early copy of a piece for review or editing, I use [Ellipsus](https://ellipsus.com/), due to its great collaboration features.

## Writing & Content Choices [#](#writing--content-choices)

What you write, how you approach it, and even how you think about where you’re publishing this work is extremely important. And, unsurprisingly for anyone who’s been a reader for a while, I have thoughts.

### Build a Website, Not a Blog [#](#build-a-website-not-a-blog)

While I will say that I’ve been blogging for decades, this is *not* a blog. This site includes a blog, but it’s *not just a blog*. I publish articles about current events, essays, research, fiction, photography, it’s also where I keep my resume, and a whole variety of other things. This goes well beyond a blog, and I encourage others to do the same.

*Why?* Let me explain.

Your site is an archive of your work, your growth, your career, and your life. Wins and losses, lessons learned, and insight into who you are – not just one facet ...
