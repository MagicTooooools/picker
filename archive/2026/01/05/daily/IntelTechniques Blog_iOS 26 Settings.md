Much like the previous article, ***Extreme Privacy, 5th Edition*** also offered many privacy and security considerations for previous versions of iOS. That content is also pushing two years old now, so I am again overdue for an update.  This article revisits that entire section for the recent changes within iOS 26.

The following assumes you are on iOS 26.1, which was the latest version at the time of writing. Now that we have let Apple offer the first major update to that OS, the menu settings should be fairly locked in. I always prefer to wait for a ".1" update before documenting specific menu settings. This guide also assumes you have already purchased and booted the mobile device, created your Apple ID, and configuring any personal customizations as explained in the book.

The purpose of this article is to revisit all of the System Settings for optimal iOS privacy and security. While everything here will work if you logged in to an iCloud account, which is different than an Apple account, some menus may appear differently. Consider it a supplement to the content within the book.

Once you can access the system on the device, the following configurations should be considered through the Settings menu. Note that some of these settings may disable features which you find desirable, and some options here might not be present within your device. Research any modifications and apply settings which are most appropriate for your usage. Never blindly accept my opinions, understand why you want the change.
