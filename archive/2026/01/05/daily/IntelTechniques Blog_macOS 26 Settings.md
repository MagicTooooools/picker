In ***Extreme Privacy, 5th Edition***, I offered many privacy and security considerations for macOS. That content is pushing two years old now, so I am probably overdue for an update.  This article revisits that entire section for the recent changes within macOS 26.

The following assumes you are on macOS 26.1, which was the latest version at the time of writing. Now that we have let Apple offer the first major update to that OS, the menu settings should be fairly locked in. I always prefer to wait for a ".1" update before documenting specific menu settings. This guide also assumes you have already purchased and booted the device, skipping the request for an Apple ID, and configuring things such as Wi-Fi, application firewall, Spotlight, Gatekeeper, FileVault, and any personal customizations as explained in the book. Consider this a supplement to that information.

The purpose of this article is to revisit all of the System Settings for optimal macOS privacy and security. Major updates are known to re-enable undesired settings, so this is a good time to check everything. While everything here will work if you logged in to an Apple account, some menus may appear differently. The following was conducted within System Settings from the Applications menu.

These basic privacy and security settings plus a properly-configured software firewall such as Little Snitch or Lulu will provide the optimal macOS setup. Most telemetry and overall Apple invasions will be eliminated and you can simply enjoy a secure operating system.
