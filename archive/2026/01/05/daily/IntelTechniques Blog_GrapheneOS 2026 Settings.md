# GrapheneOS 2026 Settings

The previous two articles deviated substantially from the content within ***Extreme Privacy, 5th Edition***. This is because Apple added many new invasions to your privacy with their latest offering. While Apple devices are extremely secure, even more so than most Android devices in my opinion, this comes at a privacy risk. The settings presented in the previous articles eliminate much of the concern for Apple users, but we have to always be watching for the next embedded data collection utility.

With GrapheneOS, there is not as much to discuss, as it has always been a bare-bones mobile operating system allowing you to add what you want instead of being force-fed new features. However, much like Apple, many things have changed over the past two years. Let's revisit the entire content for GrapheneOS customization to match their latest release.

I suspect that most of these settings will already be applied to your device. However, new features are now available and it is always good practice to confirm your desired settings annually. While GrapheneOS does not typically revert any modified system settings after an update like iOS does, individual apps may have encouraged you to disable some of the overall protection.

The following represents how I set up my own device. Some of these settings may be too restrictive for your needs. As I stated in the previous articles, do your own research and understand what these modifications change. Only then can you make the most informed choice for your needs.

Again, the following is simply a supplement to the content within the book.

* Settings > Network & internet > Private DNS > (Enter your preferred DNS)

* Settings > Security & privacy > Exploit protection > Turn off Bluetooth automatically > 1 minute

These settings provide a more hardened Android system while taking advantage of GrapheneOS's robust security features. Modify your device as needed and never let our fascination with privacy completely break the functionality of technology.
