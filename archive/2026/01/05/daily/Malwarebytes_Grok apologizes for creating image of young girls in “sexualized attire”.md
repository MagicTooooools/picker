# Grok apologizes for creating image of young girls in “sexualized attire”

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 5, 2026

![Grok logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Grok_logo.png?w=1200)

Another AI system designed to be powerful and engaging ends up illustrating how guardrails routinely fail when development speed and feature races outrun safety controls.

In a post on X, AI chatbot Grok confirmed that it generated an image of young girls in “sexualized attire.”

[![Apologizing post by Grok](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Tweet_Grok.png)](https://x.com/grok/status/2006525486021705785)

The potential violation of US laws regarding child sexual abuse material (CSAM) demonstrates the AI chatbot’s apparent [lack of guardrails](https://san.com/cc/want-to-know-where-barstool-founder-dave-portnoy-lives-just-ask-grok/). Or, at least, the guardrails are far from as effective as we’d like them to be.

xAI, the company behind Musk’s chatbot, is reviewing the incident “to prevent future issues,” and the user responsible for the prompt reportedly had their account suspended. [Reportedly](https://san.com/cc/musks-grok-ai-says-it-may-have-violated-child-abuse-laws-by-creating-photos-of-minors-in-minimal-clothing/), in a separate post on X, Grok described the incident as an isolated case and said that urgent fixes were being issued after “lapses in safeguards” were identified.

During the holiday period, we discussed how risks increased when [AI developments and features are rushed out the door](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/2025-exposed-risks-we-ignored-while-rushing-ai) without adequate safety testing. We keep pushing the limits of what AI can do faster than we can make it safe. Visual models that can sexualize minors are precisely the kind of deployment that should never go live without rigorous abuse testing.

So, while on one hand we see [geo-blocking due to national and state content restrictions](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/in-2025-age-checks-started-locking-people-out-of-the-internet), the AI linked to one of the most popular social media platforms failed to block content that many would consider far more serious than what lawmakers are currently trying to regulate. In effect, centralized age‑verification databases become breach targets while still failing to prevent AI tools from generating abusive material.

Women have also reported being targeted by Grok’s image-generation features[. One X user tweeted](https://x.com/paniniboy7/status/2006697779356467409):

> “Literally woke up to so many comments asking Grok to put me in a thong / bikini and the results having so many bookmarks. Even worse I went onto the Grok page and saw slimy disgusting lowlifes doing that to pictures of CHILDREN. Genuinely disgusting.”

We can only imagine the devastating results when [cybercriminals would abuse this type of weakness](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/01/how-ai-made-scams-more-convincing-in-2025) to defraud or extort parents with fabricated explicit content of their young ones. Tools for inserting real faces into AI-generated content are already widely available, and current safeguards appear unable to reliably prevent abuse.

This incident is yet another compelling reason to reduce your [digital footprint](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/inside-malwarebytes/2025/10/how-scammers-use-your-data-to-create-personalized-tricks-that-work). Think carefully before posting photos of yourself, [your c...
