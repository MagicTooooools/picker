## Detailed Introduction

CSGHub, developed by the OpenCSG team, is an open-source platform for managing Large Language Models (LLM) and related assets (models, datasets, spaces, code, etc.). It offers both a free SaaS experience and on-premise deployment options, supports Python SDKs, and provides Web, CLI and OpenAPI interfaces for asset lifecycle operations.

## Main Features

* Centralized LLM and asset management with upload, download, versioning and access control.
* Extensible microservice framework and plugins to integrate training, fine-tuning and inference pipelines.
* Enterprise-grade security and on-premise deployment options for compliance.
* User experience comparable to Hugging Face, with broad model format and deployment support.

## Use Cases

CSGHub suits teams and enterprises needing centralized model and data asset management: internal model registries, model distribution and auditing, offline inference deployments, private-data fine-tuning pipelines, and production platforms integrating multiple models and services.

## Technical Characteristics

CSGHub uses a microservices architecture with standardized OpenAPIs and supports Docker Compose and Kubernetes/Helm deployment. It integrates model versioning, space management and asset indexing, with pluggable storage backends and high-availability deployment patterns for end-to-end LLM lifecycle management in enterprise environments.
