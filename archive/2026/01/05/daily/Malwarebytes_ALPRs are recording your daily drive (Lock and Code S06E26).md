# ALPRs are recording your daily drive (Lock and Code S06E26)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

There’s an entire surveillance network popping up across the United States that has likely already captured your information, all for the non-suspicion of driving a car.

Automated License Plate Readers, or ALPRs, are AI-powered cameras that scan and store an image of every single vehicle that passes their view. They are mounted onto street lights, installed under bridges, disguised in water barrels, and affixed onto telephone poles, lampposts, parking signs, and even cop cars.

Once installed, these cameras capture a vehicle’s license plate number, along with its make, model, and color, and any identifying features, like a bumper sticker, or damage, or even sport trim options. Because nearly every ALPR camera has an associated location, these devices can reveal where a car was headed, and at what time, and by linking data from multiple ALPRs, it’s easy to determine a car’s daylong route and, by proxy, it’s owner’s daily routine.

This deeply sensitive information has been exposed in recent history.

In 2024, the US Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency [discovered seven vulnerabilities in cameras made by Motorola Solutions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/new-alpr-vulnerabilities-prove-mass-surveillance-public-safety-threat), and at the start of 2025, the outlet [Wired reported](https://www.wired.com/story/license-plate-reader-live-video-data-exposed/) that more than 150 ALPR cameras were leaking their live streams.

But there’s another concern with ALPRs besides data security and potential vulnerability exploits, and that’s with what they store and how they’re accessed.

ALPRs are almost uniformly purchased and used by law enforcement. These devices have been used to help solve crime, but their databases can be accessed by police who do not live in your city, or county, or even state, and who do not need a warrant before making a search.

In fact, when police access the databases managed by one major ALPR manufacturer, named Flock, one of the few guardrails those police encounter is needing to type a single word in a basic text box. When Electronic Frontier Foundation [analyzed 12 million searches made by police in Flock’s systems](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists), they learned that police sometimes filled that text box with the word “protest,” meaning that police were potentially investigating activity that is protected by the First Amendment.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Will Freeman, founder of the ALRP-tracking project [DeFlock Me](https://deflock.me/), about this growing tide of neighborhood surveillance and the flimsy protections afforded to everyday people.

> “License plate readers are a hundred percent used to circumvent the Fourth Amendment because [police] don’t have to see a judge. They don’t have to find probable cause. According to the policies of most police departments, they don’t even have to have reasonable suspicion.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
