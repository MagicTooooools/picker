# Ni8mare on Automation Street: When Workflows Turn Into an Attack Path

Change theme to light

January 15, 2026
4 Minute Read
by Nikita Kazymirskyi

[CVE-2026-21858](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21858) (Ni8mare) is a maximum-severity vulnerability in self-hosted n8n that can enable unauthenticated instance takeover, leading to remote code execution (RCE) when public webhook or form endpoints are exposed. Because n8n commonly stores and brokers API tokens, OAuth credentials, database access, and cloud keys, a compromise can quickly become a pivot into wider enterprise infrastructure. This issue lands amid a cluster of other critical n8n disclosures (including [RCE](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/critical-n8n-flaw-cvss-99-enables.html) and [sandbox-bypass paths](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/critical-n8n-flaw-cvss-99-enables.html)), increasing overall risk. The most effective response is to apply the latest updates immediately.

### Why n8n is a High-Value Target for Attackers

n8n is a workflow automation and orchestration platform used to integrate APIs, SaaS tools, cloud resources, and internal systems. In many environments, it functions as a central automation layer, connecting to messaging, CI/CD, ticketing, data stores, and cloud accounts, then executing actions using stored credentials and trusted integrations. Because of this placement, an n8n compromise can have an outsized impact, enabling attackers to access secrets, alter automation logic, and abuse legitimate integrations to pivot into other systems with far less resistance than a typical single-app breach.

### Recent Cluster of Critical n8n Vulnerabilities

Recently, multiple critical n8n issues have been disclosed. The common thread is that workflow ...
