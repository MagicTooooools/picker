Confusion reigns after claims that data linked to 17.5 million Instagram accounts is up for sale – sparked by a vague post, contradictory statements, and a flood of password reset emails nobody asked for.

And we dig into Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, after it started generating sexualised images of women and children – raising uncomfortable questions about guardrails, accountability, and why playing the censorship card doesn’t make the problem go away.

All this, and much more, in episode 450 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with Graham Cluley, and special guest Monica Verma.
