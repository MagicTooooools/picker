### Introduction

People often ask me how I maintain continuous learning and acquire new knowledge. Today, I’ll share my learning methods and information sources. In this era of information explosion, how to efficiently filter valuable information and avoid information overload is a challenge that every tech professional needs to face.

### Newsletter Subscriptions

I subscribe to several high-quality newsletters that curate the most valuable information for me daily or weekly:

* **[TLDR](https://tldr.tech/)** - Daily tech industry news digest for quickly catching up on the latest developments in the tech world
* **[selfh.st](https://selfh.st/)** - Newsletter focused on self-hosting and open-source projects, perfect for tinkerers
* **[Kube Today](https://kube.today/)** - Kubernetes-related news and technical insights, a must-read for cloud-native developers

The advantage of these newsletters is that the information has already been filtered and organized, saving a tremendous amount of time on information filtering.

### GitHub Release Tracking

As a developer, I follow Release updates for all GitHub projects I’m interested in. GitHub’s Watch feature allows you to subscribe to project release notifications, so you can be the first to know about:

* New feature releases
* Bug fixes
* Major updates

By tracking these releases, I can maintain an up-to-date understanding of my tech stack and discover interesting new features.

I regularly organize my Star list, managing projects of interest by category. You can check out the projects I follow here:

Feel free to follow my GitHub as well!

### Telegram Channel

My main information aggregation channel is my own Telegram channel, which consolidates various information sources.

👉 [Follow my channel](https://t.me/bboyapp)

#### RSS Subscriptions

I maintain an RSS subscription list that can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/bboysoulcn/rss). Through RSS, I can subscribe to various tech blogs and news sites, then push updates to my Telegram channel.

#### Deduplicated Popular Content

To avoid information duplication, I’ve implemented deduplication for content from the following sources:

* **Hacker News** - Popular discussions and articles from the programmer community
* **GitHub Trending** - The most popular open-source projects each day
* **V2EX Hot Topics** - Popular topics from the Chinese tech community

The deduplication mechanism ensures I don’t see duplicate content that appeared yesterday, improving the efficiency of information consumption.

### Other Information Sources

In addition to the main channels above, I regularly browse:

* **YouTube Subscriptions** - Tech tutorials, developer interviews, conference talks, and other video content
* **Twitter** - Following industry experts and tech leaders for first-hand information and insights. 👉 [Follow my Twitter](https://x.com/bboysoulcn)
* **Reddit** - Various tech subreddits for in-depth discussions and Q&A

### About Information Overload

In the era of information explosion, information overload is a universal problem. My coping strategy is simple:

**Only read what you can understand**

This sounds simple, but it’s the most important principle:

1. **Don’t force yourself** - If an article or technical concept is temporarily beyond your understanding, skip it for now and come back when you have the relevant foundation. I usually save articles I want to read later on Linkwarden <https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden>
2. **Depth over breadth** - Rather than skimming through 100 articles superficially, it’s better to deeply study 10 truly valuable pieces of content
3. **Practice-oriented** - Theoretical knowledge must be combined with practice; you can only truly understand by doing it yourself
4. **Establish filtering mechanisms** - Quickly scan titles and abstracts, only reading deeply into content that truly interests you

I hope this article gives you some inspiration. If you have better learning methods, feel free to share with me!
