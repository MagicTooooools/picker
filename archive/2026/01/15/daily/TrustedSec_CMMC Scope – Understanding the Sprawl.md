The CMMC program contains complex, and potentially confusing, scope requirements. Contractors that are preparing for a CMMC assessment will need to pay close attention to these requirements to achieve compliance. This includes contractors that currently meet the requirements of the DFARS 252.204-7012 contract clause due to changes in how the scope is defined. This post will explain the CMMC scope requirements and compare them to the requirements of the existing FAR 52.204-21 and DFARS 252.204-7012 requirements that CMMC is based on.

Information in this post is derived from the regulations that define the CMMC program at [32 CFR Part 170](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-32/part-170) and the scoping guides for the various CMMC Levels available on the [Department of War CIO CMMC page](https://dowcio.war.gov/CMMC/Resources-Documentation/). Unfortunately, these sources are occasionally self-contradictory and often leave room for interpretation so it shouldn’t be surprising to find some guidance that varies slightly from what is presented here.

TrustedSec is a [CMMC Registered Practitioner Organization (RPO)](https://cyberab.org/CMMC-Ecosystem/Ecosystem-roles/Consulting-and-Implementation) that can help contractors understand how to determine and minimize their CMMC scope as well as assess compliance with the requirements that apply to the scope. Please [get in touch with us](https://trustedsec.com/contact) if you need help building an efficient and effective compliance program.

## Basic Scope

This section provides a high-level overview of what assets are considered in and out-of-scope for CMMC. There is nuance to how CMMC applies to these in-scope assets depending on the applicable CMMC level and the reason why the asset is in scope. The details of the scope definitions for each CMMC levels and asset categories are explored in more detail below.

The following flowchart can be used as a quick guide to determine whether assets are in or out-of-scope. A more detailed flowchart that contains the specific requirements for each level and asset category is provided later in this post.

## FCI and CUI

The scope of CMMC is based on the flow of two types of information, Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), so it is important to understand what these are.

Contractors that are not handling FCI and/or CUI, or are handling these types of information on behalf of any government agency other than the Department of War, likely do not have CMMC compliance obligations and should review our previous post on [Why You Don't Need to be CMMC Compliant](https://trustedsec...
