EFF last summer [asked a federal judge](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/eff-court-protect-our-health-data-dhs) to block the federal government from using Medicaid data to identify and deport immigrants.

We also [warned about the danger](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/dangers-consolidating-all-government-information) of the Trump administration consolidating all of the government’s information into a single searchable, AI-driven interface with help from Palantir, a company that has a shaky-at-best record on [privacy](https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/All%20roads%20lead%20to%20Palantir%20with%20Palantir%20response%20v3.pdf) and [human rights](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/3124/2020/en/).

Now we have the first evidence that our concerns have become reality.

“Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address,” [404 Media reports today](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/). “ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based.”

The tool – dubbed Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) – receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes Medicaid) and other sources, 404 Media reports based on court testimony in Oregon by law enforcement agents, among other sources.

This revelation comes as ICE – which has gone on [a surveillance technology shopping spree](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree) – flood...
