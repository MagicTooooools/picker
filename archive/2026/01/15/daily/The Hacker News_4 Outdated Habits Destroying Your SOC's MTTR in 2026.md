It's 2026, yet many SOCs are still operating the way they did years ago, using tools and processes designed for a very different threat landscape. Given the growth in volumes and complexity of cyber threats, outdated practices no longer fully support analysts' needs, staggering investigations and incident response.

Below are four limiting habits that may be preventing your SOC from evolving at the pace of adversaries, and insights into what forward-looking teams are doing instead to achieve enterprise-grade incident response this year.

## 1. Manual Review of Suspicious Samples

Despite advances in security tools, many analysts still rely heavily on manual validation and analysis. This approach creates friction on every step, from processing samples to switching between tools and manually correlating the findings.

Manually dependent workflows are often the root cause of alert fatigue and delayed prioritization, subsequently slowing down response. These challenges are especially relevant in high-volume alert flows, which are typical for enterprises.

### What to do instead:

Modern SOCs are shifting towards automation-optimized workflows. Cloud-based malware analysis services allow teams to do full-scale threat detonations in a secure environment; no setup and maintenance needed. From quick answers to in-depth threat overview, automated sandboxes handle the groundwork without losing depth and quality of investigations. Analysts focus on higher-priority tasks and incident response.

Enterprise SOCs using ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox applies this model to **reduce MTTR by 21 minutes per incident**. Such a hands-on approach supports deep visibility into attacks, including multi-stage threats. Automated interactivity is able to deal with CAPTCHAs and QR codes that hide malicious activity with no analyst involvement. This enables analysts to gain a full understanding of the threat's behavior to act quickly and decisively.

## 2. Relying Solely on Static Scans and Reputation Checks

Static scans and reputation checks are useful, but on their own, aren't always sufficient. Open-source intelligence databases that analysts often turn to often offer outdated indicators without real-time updates. This leaves your infrastructure vulnerable to the latest attacks. Adversaries continue to enhance their tactics with unique payloads, short-lived features, and evasion techniques, preventing signature-based detection.

### What to do instead:

Leading SOCs employ behavioral analysis as the core of their operations. Detonating files and URLs in real time provides them with an instant view of malicious intent, even if it's a never-before-seen threat.

Dynamic analysis exposes the entire execution flow, enabling fast detection of advanced threats, and rich behavioral insights enable confident decisions and investigations. From network and system activity to TTPs and detection rules, ANY.RUN supports all stages of threat investigations, facilitating dynamic in-depth analysis.

The sandbox helps teams unravel detection logic, get response artifacts, network indicators, and other behavioral evidence to avoid blind zones, missed threats, and delayed action.

As a result, median **MTTD among ANY.RUN's Interactive sandbox users is 15 seconds**.

## 3. Disconnected Tools

An optimized workflow is one where no process happens in isolation from others. When SOC relies on standalone tools for each task, issues arise — around reporting, tracing, and manual processing. Lack of integration between different solutions and resources creates gaps in your workflow, and each gap is a risk. Such fragmentation increases investigation time and destroys transparency in decision-making.

### What to do instead:

SOC leaders play a key role in streamlining the workflow and introducing a unified view into all processes. Prioritizing integration of solutions to remove the gap between different stages of investigations creates a seamless workflow. This creates a full attack view for analysts in the framework of one integrated infrastructure.
