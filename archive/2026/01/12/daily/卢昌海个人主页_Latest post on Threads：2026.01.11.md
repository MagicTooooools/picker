Recently, however, my interest was rekindled by the rolling out of Gemini, and I managed to have my Nest acquire a Gemini "core". The result, unfortunately, was mixed: its language capability indeed leaped, and I'm satisfied with that. But there is a ridiculous limitation: to any question, it cuts the conversation right after the answer, which means no follow-up questions, no clarifications, no corrections, et cetera. Would anyone tolerate an assistant that behaves like that? It is almost sabotage to the quasi-human impression people have tried so hard for AI products to achieve. AI might be in a growing phase, but the human intelligence of the Google gentlemen who rolled out such a crippled service seems not.  January 11 2026　　 # Movies: The Hobbit, et al.  Watched the replay of the 2014 movie The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. I liked it, as well as the The Lord of the Rings trilogy which I watched many years ago and to which it was a prequel, far more than the Avatar movies which I also watched over a period of many years. The Avatar movies, with all the fanciness of 3D, 4DX, RPX, etc., might be technologically more advanced, but they carried a far less grand and epic atmosphere, and were quite unconvincing, if not ridiculous, in terms of battles in which a flock of flesh-and-blood beings had beaten an intruding army that was capable of interstellar travel.  >>> Later Posts  >>>>>> Follow Me On [Threads](https://www.threads.net/%40lu_changhai) or [X](https://x.com/lu_changhai) <<<<<<  https://www.changhai.org/ | |
