## Description
A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the administrator profile update functionality of \*\*CarRentalMS v2.0\*\*. The affected endpoint does not implement anti-CSRF protections, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized profile modifications on behalf of an authenticated administrator via crafted HTML content.
This issue has been assigned \*\*CVE-2025-66683\*\*.
## Affected Product
- Project: CarRentalMS
- Version: 2.0
- Vendor: Mart Mbithi
## Affected Component
- Endpoint: `/CarRentalMS/ui/backoffice\_settings`
- Functionality: Admin profile update
## Vulnerability Type
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- CWE-352
## Attack Vector
Remote. An attacker can lure an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious webpage (e.g., via a malicious advertisement or compromised website), which silently submits a forged POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
## Impact
Successful exploitation allows unauthorized modification of administrator profile details, including email address changes. This can result in:
- Full account takeover
- Privilege escalation
- Persistence establishment
- Potential data exfiltration
## Conditions for Exploitation
- Administrator is authenticated
- No anti-CSRF tokens are implemented
- No SameSite cookie protections are enforced
- User interaction with attacker-controlled HTML content
## Proof of Concept
A working proof of concept demonstrates exploitation by auto-submitting a crafted HTML form while an administrator session is active, resulting in profile data being modified without user consent.
(PoC details provided to maintainers; not fully reproduced here.)
## Mitigation Recommendations
- Implement anti-CSRF tokens (e.g., synchronizer token pattern)
- Enforce `SameSite` cookie attributes
- Validate request origin and referer headers
- Apply additional server-side authorization checks for state-changing requests
