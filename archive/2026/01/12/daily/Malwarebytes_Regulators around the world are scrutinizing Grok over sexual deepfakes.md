# Regulators around the world are scrutinizing Grok over sexual deepfakes

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
January 12, 2026

![Grok logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Grok_logo.png?w=1200)

Grok’s failure to block sexualized images of minors has turned a single “isolated lapse” into a global regulatory stress test for xAI’s ambitions. The response from lawmakers and regulators suggests this will not be solved with a quick apology and a hotfix.

Last week we reported on [Grok’s apology](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2026/01/grok-apologizes-for-creating-image-of-young-girls-in-sexualized-attire) after it generated an image of young girls in “sexualized attire.”

The apology followed the introduction of Grok’s paid “Spicy Mode” in August 2025, which was marketed as edgy and less censored. In practice it enabled users to generate sexual deepfake images, including content that may cross into illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM) under US and other jurisdictions’ laws.

A [report from web-monitoring tool CopyLeaks](https://copyleaks.com/blog/grok-and-nonconsensual-image-manipulation) highlighted “thousands” of incidents of Grok being used to create sexually suggestive images of non-consenting celebrities.

This is starting to backfire. [Reportedly](https://therecord.media/lawmakers-call-on-app-stores-to-remove-grok-x), three US senators are asking Google and Apple to remove Elon Musk’s Grok and X apps from their app stores, citing the spread of nonconsensual sexualized AI images of women and minors and arguing it violates the companies’ app store rules.

In their [joint letter](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_apple_and_google_on_removing_x_and_grok_from_app_store_192026pdf.pdf), the senators state:

> “In recent days, X users have used the app’s Grok AI tool to generate nonconsensual sexual imagery of real, private citizens at scale. This trend has included Grok modifying images to depict women being sexually abused, humiliated, hurt, and even killed. In some cases, Grok has reportedly created sexualized images of children—the most heinous type of content imaginable.”

The UK government also threatens to take possible action against the platform. Government officials have said they would fully support any action taken by Ofcom, the independent media regulator, against X. Even if that meant UK regulators could block the platform.

Indonesia and Malaysia already blocked Grok after its “digital undressing” function flooded the internet with suggestive and obscene manipulated images of women and minors.

As it turns out, a user prompted Grok to generate its own “apology,” which it did. After backlash over sexualized images of women and minors, Grok/X announced limits on image generation and editing for paying subscribers only, effectively paywalling those capabilities on main X surfaces.

For lawmakers already worried about disinformation, election interference, deepfakes, and abuse imagery, Grok is fast becoming the textbook case for why “[move fast and break things](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/2025-exposed-risks-we-ignored-while-rushing-ai)” doesn’t mix with AI that can sexualize real people on demand.

Hopefully, the next wave of rules, ranging from EU AI enforcement to platform-specific safety obligations, will treat this incident as the baseline risk that all large-scale visual models must withstand, not as an outlier.
