This week made one thing clear: small oversights can spiral fast. Tools meant to save time and reduce friction turned into easy entry points once basic safeguards were ignored. Attackers didn't need novel tricks. They used what was already exposed and moved in without resistance.

Scale amplified the damage. A single weak configuration rippled out to millions. A repeatable flaw worked again and again. Phishing crept into apps people rely on daily, while malware blended into routine system behavior. Different victims, same playbook: look normal, move quickly, spread before alarms go off.

For defenders, the pressure keeps rising. Vulnerabilities are exploited almost as soon as they surface. Claims and counterclaims appear before the facts settle. Criminal groups adapt faster each cycle. The stories that follow show where things failed—and why those failures matter going forward.

## **⚡ Threat of the Week**

**[Maximum Severity Security Flaw Disclosed in n8n](https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/critical-n8n-vulnerability-cvss-100.html)** — A maximum-severity vulnerability in the n8n workflow automation platform permits unauthenticated remote code execution and potential full system compromise. The flaw, referred to as Ni8mare and tracked as CVE‑2026‑21858, affects [locally deployed instances](https://community.n8n.io/t/security-advisory-security-vulnerability-in-n8n-versions-1-65-1-120-4/247305) running versions prior to 1.121.0. The issue stems from how n8n handles incoming data, offering a direct path from an external, unauthenticated request to compromise the automation environment. The disclosure of CVE‑2026‑21858 follows several other high‑impact vulnerabilities publicized over the past two weeks, including CVE‑2026‑21877, CVE‑2025‑68613, and CVE‑2025‑68668. The problem appears in [Form-based workflows](https://socradar.io/blog/ni8mare-flaw-n8n-cve-2026-21858/) where file-handling functions are executed without first validating that the request was actually processed as "multipart/form-data." This loophole allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request using a non-file content type while crafting the request body to mimic the internal structure expected for uploaded files. Because the parsing logic does not verify the format of the incoming data, it enables an attacker to access arbitrary file paths on the n8n host and even escalate it to code execution. "The impact extends to any organization using n8n to automate workflows that interact with sensitive systems," Field Effect [said](https://fieldeffect.com/blog/maximum-severity-ni8mare-flaw-exposes-n8n-to-full-system-compromise). "The worst‑case scenario involves full system compromise and unauthorized access to connected services." However, Horizon3.ai [noted](https://horizon3.ai/attack-research/attack-blogs/the-ni8mare-test-n8n-rce-under-the-microscope-cve-2026-21858/) that successful exploitation requires a combination of pre-requisites that are unlikely to be found in most real-world deployments: An n8n form component workflow that's publicly accessible without authentication and a mechanism to retrieve the local files from the n8n server. As of January 11, 2026, there are about [59,500 internet-exposed hosts](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/time-series/?date_range=other_range&d1=2026-01-08&d2=2026-01-11&source=http_vulnerable&source=http_vulnerable6&tag=cve-2026-21858%2B&dataset=unique_ips&limit=100&group_by=geo&stacking=stacked&auto_update=on) that are still vulnerable to CVE-2026-21858. More than 27,000 IP addresses are [located](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/tree/?date_range=1&source=http_vulnerable&source=http_vulnerable6&tag=cve-2026-21858%2B&data_set=count&scale=log&auto_update=on) in the U.S. and over 21,200 in Europe.

* **[Kimwolf Botnet Infects 2M Android Devices](https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/kimwolf-android-botnet-infects-over-2.html)** — The Kimwolf botnet, an Android variant of the Aisuru malware, has grown to more than two million hosts, most of them infected by exploiting vulnerabilities in residential proxy networks to target devices on internal networks. Kimwolf's rapid growth is largely fueled by its abuse of residential proxy networks to reach vulnerable Android devices. Specifically, the malware takes advantage of proxy providers that permit access to local network addresses and ports, allowing direct interaction with devices running on the same internal network as the proxy client. Starting on November 12, 2025, Synthient observed elevated activity scanning for unauthenticated ADB services exposed through proxy endpoints, targeting ports 5555, 5858, 12108, and 3222. The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a development and debugging interface that allows installing and removing apps, running shell commands, transferring files, and debugging Android devices. When exposed over a network, ADB can allow unauthorized remote connections to modify or take control of Android devices. When reachable, botnet payloads were delivered via netcat or telnet, piping shell scripts directly into the ex...
