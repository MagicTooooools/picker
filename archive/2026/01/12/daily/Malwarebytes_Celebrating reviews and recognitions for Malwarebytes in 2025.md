# Celebrating reviews and recognitions for Malwarebytes in 2025

Independent recognition matters in cybersecurity, and it matters a lot to us. It shows how security products perform when they’re tested against in-the-wild threats, using lab environments designed to reflect what people actually face in the real world.

In 2025, [Malwarebytes earned awards and recognition](https://www.malwarebytes.com/awards-and-recognition) from a steady stream of third-party testing labs and industry groups. Here’s what those tests looked like and what they found.

### AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation: Real-world malware, real results

Malwarebytes earned another[Advanced In-The-Wild badge](https://avlab.pl/en/advanced-in-the-wild-malware-test/recent-results/) from AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation in 2025, continuing a run of accolades.

In November, AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation tested 244 real-world [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) samples across 14 cybersecurity products. Malwarebytes Premium Security detected every single one. On top of that, it removed threats with an average remediation time of 2.18 seconds—nearly 12 seconds faster than the industry average.

That result also marked our third Excellent badge in 2025, following earlier tests in July and September.

Earlier in the year, Malwarebytes Premium Security was also named [Product of the Year](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/03/malwarebytes-premium-security-awarded-product-of-the-year-from-avlab) for the third consecutive year, after it blocked 100% of in-the-wild [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) samples.

### MRG Effitas: Consistent Android protection, proven over time

For the seventh consecutive time, Malwarebytes earned [MRG Effitas’ Android 360° Certificate](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/08/malwarebytes-earns-mrg-effitas-android-360-certificate-for-mobile-threat-detection) in November, one of the toughest [independent tests in mobile security](https://www.mrg-effitas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MRG_Android_360_2025q1_v100.pdf), underscoring the strength and reliability of [Malwarebytes Mobile Security](https://app.malwarebytes.com/AgCJ/grb5w2g1).

[MRG Effitas](https://www.mrg-effitas.com/) conducted in-depth testing of [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) [antivirus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus) apps using real-world scenarios, combining in-the-wild malware with benign samples to assess detection gaps and weaknesses.

Our mobile protection received the highest marks, achieving a near-perfect detection rate in MRG Effitas’ rigorous lab testing, reaffirming what our customers already know: Malwarebytes stops threats before they can cause harm.

### PCMag Readers’ Choice Awards: Multiple category wins

Not all validation comes from labs. In [PCMag’s 2025 Readers’ Choice Awards](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/11/malwarebytes-aces-pcmag-readers-choice-awards-and-avlab-cybersecurity-foundation-tests), Malwarebytes topped three [award](https://uk.pcmag.com/news/160852/readers-choice-2025-the-privacy-and-security-apps-you-trust-the-most) categories based on reader feedback: Best PC Security Suite, Best [Android Antivirus]...
