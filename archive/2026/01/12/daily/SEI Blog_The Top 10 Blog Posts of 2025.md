Every January on the SEI Blog, we present the 10 most-visited posts from the previous year. This year’s top 10 list highlights the SEI’s work in software acquisition, artificial intelligence, threat modeling, machine learning test and evaluation, and enterprise risk management. The posts, all published in 2025, are presented below in reverse order based on the number of visits.

10. [**Perspectives on Generative AI in Software Engineering and Acquisition**](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/blog/perspectives-on-generative-ai-in-software-engineering-and-acquisition/)

In the realm of software engineering and software acquisition, generative AI promises to improve developer productivity and rate of production of related artifacts, and in some cases their quality. It is essential, however, that software and acquisition professionals learn how to apply AI-augmented methods and tools in their workflows effectively. This blog post focuses on the future of software engineering and acquisition using generative AI technologies, such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [DALL·E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/), and [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/kwgafqKo3MozPth1viDEa), and explores experts’ perspectives of applying generative AI in software engineering and acquisition. It is the latest in a series of blog posts on these topics.

The blog post includes perspectives from SEI Fellow [Anita Carleton](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/authors/anita-carleton/), director of the SEI [Software Solutions Division](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/software-solutions-division/), along with a group of SEI thought leaders on AI and software including [James Ivers](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/authors/james-ivers/), principal engineer; [Ipek Ozkaya](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/authors/ipek-ozkaya/), technical director of the Engineering Intelligent Software Systems group; [John Robert](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/authors/john-robert/), deputy director of the Software Solutions Division; [Douglas Schmidt](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=douglas-schmidt), who was the [Director of Operational Test and Evaluation](https://www.dote.osd.mil/About/Leadership1/Bio_Display/Article/3733808/the-honorable-dr-douglas-c-schmidt/) at the Department of Defense (DoD) and is now the [inaugural dean of the School of Computing, Data Sciences, and Physics](https://news.wm.edu/2024/10/03/renowned-computer-scientist-alumnus-to-lead-wms-new-school-of-computing-data-sciences-physics/) at [William & Mary](http://www.wm.edu/); and [Shen Zhang](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/authors/shen-zhang/), a senior engineer.

In his yearly reflection and anticipation blog post, CERT Director Greg Touhill calls upon his decades of experience as an information technology and cybersecurity senior executive and what he has learned leading the SEI’s CERT Division (one of the first organizations dedicated to cyber research and response) and channels the spirit of the nearby [Punxsutawney Phil](https://www.groundhog.org/), that famous prognosticating Pennsylvania groundhog, to look into 2025 and forecast what we will likely reflect upon at the end of this year.

8. [**Stop Imagining Threats, Start Mitigating Them: A Practical Guide to Threat Modeling**](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/blog/stop-imagining-threats-start-mitigating-them-a-practical-guide-to-threat-modeling/)

When building a software-intensive system, [a key part in creating a secure and robust solution is to develop a cyber threat model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling). Threat models are important because they guide requirements, system design, and operational choices. This blog post focuses on a method threat modelers can use to make credible claims about attacks the system could face and to ground those claims in observations of adversary [tactics, techniques, and procedures](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/tactics_techniques_and_procedures) (TTPs).

6. [**Artificial Intelligence in National Security: Acquisition and Integration**](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-national-security-acquisition-and-integration/)
 *by Paige Rishel, Carol J. Smith, Brigid O’Hearn, and Rita C. Creel*

As defense and national security organizations consider integrating AI into their operations, many acquisition teams are unsure of where to start. In June, the SEI hosted an AI Acquisition workshop. This blog post details practitioner insights from the workshop, including challenges in differentiating AI systems, guidance on when to use AI, and matching AI tools to mission needs.

 5. [**Out of Distribution Detection: Knowing When AI Doesn’t Know**](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/blog/out-of-distribution-detection-knowing-when-ai-doesnt-know/)
 *by Eric Heim and Cole Frank*

A critical challenge in artificial intelligence is knowing when an AI system is operating outside its intended knowledge boundaries. This is the critical domain of out-of-distribution (OoD) detection—identifying when an AI system is facing situations it wasn’t t...
