In episode 83 of The AI Fix, Graham reveals he’s taken up lying to LLMs, and shows how a journalist exposed AI bluffers with a made-up idiom. Meanwhile Mark invents a “Godwin’s Law” for AI, and explains how to ruin any LLM with humus.

Also in this episode, a marriage is declared invalid thanks to ChatGPT, an AI barman looks for a job in a quiet pub, OpenAI finally unveils ChatGPT Health, and why news of the death of Stack Overflow may be greatly exaggerated.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of “The AI Fix” podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
