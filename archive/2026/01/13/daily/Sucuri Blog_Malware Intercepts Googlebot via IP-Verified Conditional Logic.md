![Malware Intercepts Googlebot via IP](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Malware-Intercepts-Googlebot-via-IP-820x385.png)

Some attackers are increasingly moving away from simple redirects in favor of more “selective” methods of payload delivery. This approach filters out regular human visitors, allowing attackers to serve malicious content to search engine crawlers while remaining invisible to the website owner.

![IP-Verified Conditional Logic](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IP-Verified-Conditional-Logic.png)

## What did we find?

During a malware investigation, we identified a selective content injection attack inside the main **index.php** file of a WordPress website.

Instead of always loading WordPress normally, this modified file checks who is visiting the site. Based on that decision, it either loads external third-party content or simply loads the clean, unmodified page.

We recently published an article on a similar attack involving [SEO cloaking](https://blog.sucuri.net/2026/01/google-sees-spam-you-see-your-site-a-cloaked-seo-spam-attack.html).

This image shows how the website looked to Google while the visitors were still seeing the original website content.

![What Google sees](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/What-Google-sees.png)

## What was new this time?

While cloaking is a known tactic, the level of technical detail in this specific script was unusually high. Most attackers simply filter on the User-Agent header to check for bots. In this case, the malware contained a large, hardcoded library of Google’s ASN (Autonomous System Number) IP ranges in CIDR format.

### What are Google’s ASN (Autonomous System Number) IP ranges:

An ASN is like Google’s official internet identity. It represents the group of IP addresses that Google owns and uses for its services such as Gmail, Search, and Google Cloud. If traffic comes from Google’s ASN, this means it is coming from Google’s real infrastructure, not from an unknown or fake source.

### What is CIDR format:

CIDR is a compact way to describe a block of IP addresses instead of listing them one by one. It tells you how large the IP range is and which addresses belong together, making it easier for systems to manage, allow, or block traffic efficiently.

A simple example of CIDR format is:

192.168.1.0/24

This means all IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 belong to the same range. The “**/24**” tells how large the range is.

What made this malicious code unique was its use of low-level bitwise operations to verify visitors. Instead of simple string matching, the script performs mathematical calculations to determine whether a visitor’s IP fits perfectly within a specific network block. It also included robust support for IPv6 addresses, which many older cloaking scripts ignore. By using these advanced methods, the attacker ensured that their hidden content was only visible to legitimate search engine infrastructure, making it nearly impossible to detect through standard manual browsing.

## What this infection does to your website

The impact of this specific infection is primarily focused on SEO and search reputation. Because the site serves different content to Google than to humans, the consequences include:

Search Engine Blacklisting, SEO deindexing, resource hijacking, delayed detection, etc.

## Warning signs that something is wrong

If you suspect your site has been compromised by this crawler interception malware, look for the following indicators:

* Bad Google Search Engine Results.
* Any recently modified files
* Suspicious URLs
* Unexpected Logs

At the time of writing, the malicious domain **amp-samaresmanor**[**.**]**pages**[**.**]**dev** is blocklisted by [2 security vendors on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/5a006beedf563c6215a31746d011d13fd4f2561a1bf3b557484c4532b13e1ec6?nocache=1), and currently, [5 websites](https://publicwww.com/websites/amp-samaresmanor.pages/) are infected with this.
