## 1980s Hacker Manifesto

Forty years ago, The Mentor—[Loyd Blankenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Blankenship)—published “[The Conscience of a Hacker](https://phrack.org/issues/7/3)” in *Phrack*.

> You bet your ass we’re all alike… we’ve been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak… the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We’ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.
>
> This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn’t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore… and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge… and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias… and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it’s for our own good, yet we’re the criminals.
>
> Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

The beauty of the baud. Thanks Bruce for reminding me of one of the seminal bits of cultural literacy that shaped my future and probably many others’, too.

This piece reflects a tension I’ve observed for decades: society often fears what it doesn’t understand, and hackers live squarely in that space. True hackers are motivated by curiosity, the pursuit of knowledge, and a desire to explore systems—not to cause harm. Yet, the legal and cultural frameworks we’ve built treat that curiosity as inherently criminal. It’s ironic when you consider the far more damaging behaviors routinely tolerated in corporate and governmental spheres. In the end, our security—and our progress—depend on embracing the inquisitive minds willing to challenge the status quo.

Thanks for posting this, I was deep in the scene and remember when this came out. I suspect I’ll be doing down a rabbit hole catching up, somewhere along the line I was absorbed by the corporate world.

Time to remember where I came from.

It is very easy to see why someone would express the above, after all it looks like a clear picture. Corporations are evil and so on.

However one very important datum must be recognized, the correct target.

If mom does not want to give you that cookie, beating up your brother is the wrong target. And yet many do.

A messed up society that does not understand itself is, well messed up. What would be the best goal in pursuing a solution? One which helps as many as possible and hurt the fewest.

Don’t get me wrong, corporations are this legal entity under which many crimes are being justified – all for the investors. Allow people to hide behind something and they will sell their souls even for just a piece of chocolate.

Many, understandably, feel OK if society fails because they think it could not get any worse. Thing is a crash of society will offer even less to the individual and demand more to just stay alive. The attack angle should be what can I do which would be an effective blow that will help as much as possible for as many as possible with the least hurt.

When you set out to correct wrongs it is important to keep this in mind. Think win – win. Win – loose has a solid history of becoming loose – loose.

Fight the good fight with integrity and full knowledge of the outcome of your actions. Education of all parties is a secret weapon to accomplish many a goal. When understanding is achieved solutions become obvious. When a person actually realize the effects of their actions they want to make up for the damage they caused. This is true for all but the most lost.

> My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.

This is a crime indeed. People must be judged by their actions alone. I don’t care what you think or say. I’m always watching what your hands are doing.

Also, arguing with a 40 year old text on the internet is a silly thing to do. Don’t judge me on that.

Steve, above, I have just one thing to say in response: <https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-cfo-warns-credit-card-rate-cap-could-hurt-us-consumers-economy-2026-01-13/>

(Meanwhile, my credit union card is under 10%).

This is theft. His comment applies to the telephone companies phone lines… The marginal cost looks like 0 but the business has to pay the capital costs of building that infrastructure. And turn a profit for itself.

From what I remember the cost went down due to the competition, MCI etc, and not from shaming the Bells
