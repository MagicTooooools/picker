# Secure What’s Next: How a World-Class MSSP Builds Trust and Scale for 2026

Jesse Emerson, Chief Product Officer at LevelBlue, the world’s largest pure-play [Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)](/services/managed-security-services/), recently sat down to answer a few questions about what makes an MSSP a valuable client resource and how he sees the MSSP’s role changing in the coming year.

### **Question**: **What makes a world-class MSSP?**

**Jesse Emerson** - There are many things an MSSP must have to be considered at the top.

First, there's the breadth of their portfolio. How many problems and challenges can that provider help their clients address? And that extends not only to the managed offerings but also to the consultative services they provide to help clients reach the security program outcomes that really matter. Next, there's the breadth of technologies an MSSP can support with deep expertise and integration. Most organizations have dozens of different tools and vendor technologies at play in their cybersecurity program. The ability to simplify a client’s experience in getting value out of those investments with their MSSP is key.

Finally, transparency is extremely important. This is the way an MSSP can establish a trusting relationship with its clients.

Really, it's a wide breadth of capabilities and characteristics exhibited by MSSPs with me on the panel and likely across the [MSSP Alert’s Top MSSP 250](https://www.msspalert.com/top-250-2025?page=21).
