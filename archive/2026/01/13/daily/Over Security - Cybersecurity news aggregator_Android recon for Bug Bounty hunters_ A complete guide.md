# Android recon for Bug Bounty hunters: A complete guide from APK extraction to mapping attack surfaces

Found an interesting Android target in a Bug Bounty Program but have no idea where to begin?

Once you’ve [*built your Android lab*](https://www.yeswehack.com/learn-bug-bounty/android-lab-mobile-hacking-tools), the next crucial step is performing recon on the scope in question.

This guide walks you through the complete Android reconnaissance process – from extracting the APK to mapping every endpoint, secret and vulnerable component. You’ll learn the exact workflow professional hunters use to uncover critical vulnerabilities without even launching the app.

In your first reconnaissance session, you’ll master:

* Extracting APKs from the Play Store, devices or third-party repositories
* Running static analysis to find API endpoints, hardcoded credentials and security misconfigurations
* Leveraging automated tools like MobSF, MARA and Drozer to catch common vulnerabilities
* Performing manual deep-dive analysis with jadx-gui to spot business logic flaws
* Building a prioritised attack list ready for exploitation testing

## Why effective Android reconnaissance makes all the difference

Many Bug Bounty hunters make the same costly mistake: they install the app, fire up Burp Suite and start clicking through the interface haphazardly in the hope of stumbling upon vulnerabilities. They’re testing blind.

This approach fails for a simple reason: you’re limited to what the user interface exposes. Meanwhile, the app’s codebase contains dozens of hidden endpoints, forgotten debug features, hardcoded credentials and vulnerable components that never appear in normal usage. These hidden elements are where critical findings typically live.

In our previous guide on [*building an Android mobile hacking lab*](https://www.yeswehack.com/fr/learn-bug-bounty/android-lab-mobile-hacking-tools), we showed you how to set up emulators, rooted devices and runtime tools like Frida. This equips you to handle dynamic testing – but you need to understand what you’re testing first.

Recon reveals the complete attack surface before you run a single request through your proxy. These attack vectors can include:

* **Hidden API endpoints** that developers forgot to remove or never documented – staging servers, admin panels and legacy APIs still accessible in production
* **Hardcoded secrets** living directly in the code – eg AWS keys granting cloud infrastructure access, Firebase URLs pointing to misconfigured databases, OAuth tokens that bypass authentication
* **Forgotten components** left enabled in production – eg debug activities that expose sensitive functionality, backup flags allowing data extraction without root access
* **Vulnerable dependencies** that developers never update – eg third-party libraries with known exploits, outdated SDKs containing critical CVEs
* **Logic flaws** in authentication and authorisation – eg client-side checks that can be bypassed, weak token validation, improper session management
* **Weak cryptography** implemented by developers who don’t understand security – eg custom encryption algorithms, hardcoded keys, insecure random number generation
* **Cloud service misconfigurations** – eg Firebase databases without access rules, publicly readable S3 buckets, exposed Google Cloud storage containers

Think about military strategy. Soldiers don’t charge into unknown territory; they study maps, identify weak points in defences, understand enemy positions. Reconnaissance provides that intelligence advantage.

A thorough recon workflow gives you two decisive advantages over other hunters:

### Recon advantage #1: efficiency

You know exactly where to focus your limited testing time instead of randomly exploring the interface. When you’ve identified potential vulnerabilities through static analysis, you can systematically validate each one instead of hoping to discover something through trial and error. In short, you can achieve much more in less time.

### Recon advantage #2: finding subtler, high-impact bugs

You can find critical and high-severity issues that researchers hunting ‘blind’ will miss. While they’re still testing login forms, you’ve already reported a critical Firebase misconfiguration because the decompiled code told you exactly where to look.

Real understanding comes from combining automated tools with manual analysis. Scanners catch only surface-level issues: missing security flags, known CVEs, hardcoded API keys in plaintext. Manual analysis, by contrast, catches subtle flaws: business logic vulnerabilities, context-specific misconfigurations, clever exploits that require an understanding of the developer’s intentions.

## APK extraction methods: getting your target’s source code

Before analysing anything, you need the actual APK file. The necessary extraction method depends on your target’s distribution and your access level.

### Downloading directly from Google Play Store

This is the fastest approach for publicly available apps, letting you download APKs directly from Google’s servers without using a device or installing the app.

**Why this matters**: Official Play Store versions reflect the production code users run in the wild. They contain the actual production code you need to analyse, complete with all dependencies and resources. Third-party sources sometimes host modified or outdated versions that waste your precious testing time.

### Using APKeep for authenticated downloads

APKeep is a command-line tool that downloads APK files directly from Google Play Store or APKPure-hosted mirrors without requiring a physical device or manual browser interaction.

For instance:

```
1# Install APKeep (requires Rust)

2cargo install --git https://github.com/EFForg/apkeep.git

3

4# Download the latest version

5apkeep-a com.instagram.android .
```

This pulls from APKPure’s mirrored builds, which don’t require credentials but may lag behind the official release by a few hours.

For architecture-specific variants, specify the build type:

```
1apkeep-a com.instagram.android -o'arch=x86' .
```

**Why architecture matters**: Some apps ship native libraries (.so files) containing security-critical code. The x86 version might include different vulnerabilities to the ARM version, especially in custom cryptography or network implementations.

### Direct Play Store access with OAuth

For the latest version, authenticate with Google Play directly. First, obtain an OAuth token:

* Visit Google’s embedded setup page
* Open browser developer tools (Network tab)
* Log into your Google account
* Accept Terms of Service if prompted
* Find the final request to accounts.google.com
* Locate the `oauth_token` cookie in the response
* Copy the value (starts with `oauth2_4/`)
