# Data broker fined after selling Alzheimer’s patient info and millions of sensitive profiles

by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury) |
January 13, 2026

California’s privacy regulator has [fined](https://cppa.ca.gov/announcements/2026/20260108.html) a Texas data broker $45,000 and banned it from selling Californians’ personal information after it sold Alzheimer patients’ data. Texan company Rickenbacher Data LLC, which does business as Datamasters, bought and resold the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of people that suffered from serious health conditions, [according to](https://therecord.media/ccpa-fines-data-broker-selling-lists-alzheimers) the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA).

The CPPA’s [final order](https://cppa.ca.gov/pdf/datamasters_order_signed.pdf) against Datamasters says that the company maintained a database containing 435,245 postal addresses for Alzheimer’s patients. But it didn’t stop there. Also up for grabs were records for 2,317,141 blind or visually impaired people, and 133,142 addiction sufferers. It also sold records for 857,449 people with bladder control issues.

Health-related data wasn’t the only category Datamasters trafficked in. The company also sold information tied to ethnicity, including so-called “Hispanic lists” containing more than 20 million names, as well as age-based “senior lists” and indicators of financial vulnerability. For example, it sold records of people holding high-interest mortgages.

And if buyers wanted data on other likely customer characteristics and actions, such as who was likely a liberal vs a right-winger, it could give you that, too, thanks to 3,370 “Consumer Predictor Models” spanning automotive preferences, financial activity, media use, political affiliation, and nonprofit activity.

Datamasters offers outright purchase of records from its national consumer database, which it claims covers 114 million households and 231 million individuals. Customers can also buy subscription-based updates too.

California regulators began investigating Datamasters after discovering the company had failed to register as a data broker in the state, as required under California’s Delete Act. The law has required data brokers to register since January 31, 2025.

The company originally denied that it did business in California or had data on Californians. However, that claim collapsed when regulators found an Excel spreadsheet on the website listing 204,218 California student records.

Datamasters first said it had not screened its national database to remove Californians’ data. After getting a lawyer, it changed its story, asserting that it did in fact filter Californians out of the data set. That didn’t convince the CPPA though.

The regulator acknowledged that Datamasters did try to comply with Californian privacy laws, but that it

> “lacked sufficient written policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Delete Act.”

The fine imposed on Datamasters also takes into account that it hadn’t registered on the state’s data broker registry. Data brokers that don’t register [are liable](https://privacy.ca.gov/data-brokers/) for $200 per day in fines, and failing to delete consumer data will incur $200 per consumer per day in fines.

Starting January 1, 2028, data brokers registered in California will also be required to undergo independent third-party compliance audits every three years.
