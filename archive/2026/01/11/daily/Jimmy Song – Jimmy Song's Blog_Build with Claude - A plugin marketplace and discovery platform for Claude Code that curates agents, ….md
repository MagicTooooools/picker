## Detailed Introduction

Build with Claude is a plugin marketplace and discovery platform for Claude Code that aggregates agents, commands, hooks, skills, and plugin collections to make it easy to browse, search, and install community and curated extensions. The project provides a Web UI and a repository-style plugin layout, enabling installation via the Claude plugin marketplace or manual updates for controlled deployments. It helps teams integrate agent-driven automation into their workflows.

## Main Features

* Rich plugin collections covering agents (language and domain experts), commands (commit, docs, TDD), and hooks (event-driven automation).
* Marketplace discovery with filtering, search, and one-click copyable install commands; supports bundled collection installs.
* MCP and community indexing to find MCP servers, connectors, and third-party marketplaces.
* Multi-install options: marketplace integration and manual repository-based installation for different operational needs.

## Use Cases

* Rapidly deploy domain-specific agents to assist with coding, reviews, and testing workflows.
* Automate routine development tasks via commands and hooks (formatting, commits, docs generation).
* Curate vetted plugins for regulated environments to ensure compliance and auditability.
* Serve as a community discovery portal to explore and try third-party plugins and collections.

## Technical Characteristics

* Repository-driven plugin manifests and metadata enable automated installs and updates.
* Web UI for visual browsing, filtering, and usage examples to improve discoverability.
* Native support for Claude Code marketplace installation flows.
* Documentation and contribution guides define plugin formats and validation for contributors.
