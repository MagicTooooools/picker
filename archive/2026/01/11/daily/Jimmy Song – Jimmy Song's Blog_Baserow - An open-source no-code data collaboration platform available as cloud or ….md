## Detailed Introduction

Baserow is an open-source no-code data collaboration platform for teams and organizations, offering spreadsheet-like databases, visual views, and workflow automation. It is available as a hosted cloud service as well as a self-hosted deployment to meet compliance and data sovereignty needs. Baserow has integrated AI features to accelerate data modeling and application building, including field suggestions, automation triggers, and a built-in AI assistant (referred to as an agent).

## Main Features

* Spreadsheet-style database with multiple views (grid, kanban, calendar) to suit diverse use cases.
* Robust API and plugin extensibility for integrating third-party systems and custom frontend/backend extensions.
* Built-in automation engine to compose triggers and actions and connect with external services.
* Hosted and self-hosted deployment options to satisfy enterprise compliance (GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2) and data governance.
* Increasing AI capabilities (field suggestions, agent assistant) to speed up application creation and data governance.

## Use Cases

* Migrate scattered spreadsheets into a shared structured database for project management, asset tracking, and CRM.
* Rapidly build low-code applications and dashboards to meet business needs without heavy engineering resources.
* Orchestrate workflows and integrate systems using automations and webhooks.
* Self-host in regulated environments to maintain data sovereignty and auditability.

## Technical Characteristics

* Backend primarily written in Python and offering a RESTful API with an extensible plugin architecture.
* Persists data in PostgreSQL, enabling scalability and reliability.
* Designed with observability and operations in mind (logging, audit, backups) for enterprise deployments.
* API-first design allows Baserow to serve as a data layer and low-code application platform for other systems.
