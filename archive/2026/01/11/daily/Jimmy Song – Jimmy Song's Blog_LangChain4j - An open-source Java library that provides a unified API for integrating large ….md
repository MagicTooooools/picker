## Detailed Introduction

LangChain4j is an open-source Java library designed to simplify integrating large language models (LLMs) and vector databases into enterprise Java applications. It offers a unified API, connectors, and examples to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, tool calling (including MCP-like patterns), and agent-style workflows, enabling Java developers to leverage model capabilities within familiar, production-ready engineering environments.

## Main Features

* Unified Java API that abstracts popular LLM providers and embeddings/vector database interactions.
* Native support for RAG patterns, tool calling, and agent workflows.
* Enterprise adapters for easy integration with Spring and Jakarta EE applications.
* Extensive examples and documentation, including deployment and performance guidance.

## Use Cases

* Provide semantic search and question-answering services (RAG) in backend systems.
* Add summarization, classification, or text-generation capabilities to business workflows with Java-native integration.
* Build agent-like workflows that call external tools or databases to automate processes.
* Maintain compliance and auditability when using self-hosted or controlled model deployments in enterprise settings.

## Technical Characteristics

* Designed for the Java ecosystem with easy CI/CD and build tool integration.
* Supports multiple vector storage backends such as Chroma, Milvus, and PGVector.
* Emphasizes observability and engineering best practices: logging, metrics, and robust error handling.
* Official documentation site contains guides and examples for quick onboarding.
