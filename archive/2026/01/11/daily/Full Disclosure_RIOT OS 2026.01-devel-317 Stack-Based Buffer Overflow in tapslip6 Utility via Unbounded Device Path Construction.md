```
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tapslip6 utility
distributed with RIOT OS (and derived from the legacy uIP/Contiki
networking tools). The vulnerability is caused by unsafe string
concatenation in the devopen() function, which constructs a device path
using unbounded user-controlled input.
Specifically, tapslip6 uses strcpy() and strcat() to concatenate the fixed
prefix "/dev/" with a user-supplied device name provided via the -s
command-line option. No bounds checking is performed, allowing an attacker
to supply an excessively long device name and overflow a fixed-size stack
buffer. This issue can lead to process crashes and memory corruption. While
exploitation requires local access, the affected utility is commonly
executed with elevated privileges during development, testing, or
deployment of RIOT OS networking environments, increasing impact.

*Root Cause:*int devopen(const char *dev, int flags)
{
    char t[1024];
    strcpy(t, "/dev/");
    strcat(t, dev);
    return open(t, flags);
}

*Impact:*

   - Stack-based buffer overflow
   - Process termination (Denial of Service)
   - Memory corruption

*Proof of Concept:*./tapslip6 -s $(python3 - << 'EOF'
print("A"*3000)
EOF
) 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0

*Output:*=================================================================
