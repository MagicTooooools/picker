## Detailed Introduction

Spice.ai is an open-source accelerated engine for time-series and structured data, designed to embed data-driven ML and inference capabilities directly into production applications. Implemented in Rust, the project provides fast SQL-like queries, full-text search, and LLM inference integration, supporting low-latency online inference and portable deployments. See the documentation at [docs.spiceai.org](https://docs.spiceai.org).

## Main Features

* Accelerated SQL queries and time-series feature processing for building real-time features from raw data.
* Integration with LLMs for data-grounded generation and retrieval-augmented inference.
* Portable, low-latency runtime suitable for cloud, containerized, and edge deployments.
* Developer-friendly toolchain and SDKs for quick integration and experimentation in applications.

## Use Cases

Ideal for embedding time-series ML into applications such as real-time monitoring and alerting, predictive maintenance, personalized recommendations, financial risk detection, and operational metric forecasting. Engineering teams can use Spice.ai as the real-time decision layer that brings model inference directly into business workflows.

## Technical Features

Built primarily in Rust for performance and reliability, the project includes hybrid retrieval and re-ranking capabilities, plugin-based inference backends (supporting multiple model services), and production-focused deployment guides and images. Licensed under Apache-2.0 for industrial adoption.
