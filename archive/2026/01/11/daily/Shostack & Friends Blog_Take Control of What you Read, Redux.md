# Take Control of What you Read, Redux

In 2026, it’s more important than ever to take control of what you read
![A person with wires and dials coming out of their skull. They're in a library but chained to a desk and unable to reach books.](/images/blog/img/2026/take-control-of-what-you-read-redux-1000w.png)

Back in 2023, I talked about [taking control of
what you read via RSS](https://shostack.org/blog/take-control-of-what-you-read/), and I
want to update and enhance that
advice.

Take control of what you read so your reading best serves you.

When you read on the big corporate platforms (the five sites that
mostly consist of screenshots of
the others), you're reading
micro-thinking, lacking in nuance,
not grappling with complexity, and
selected for outrage and
engagement. And look, maybe you
want a quick hit of reinforcement,
a simplification of the world’s
complexities, or something else which the format gives
you? Cool. I encourage you to express what that is, and what
fraction of your time you want that.

Joan Westenberg has a good piece [Blogging in the Ruins](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/), about
the value that blogging brings. One of the points she makes is
“Their authors accept that most posts won't go viral, and that's
fine.” Not only is that fine, but I don’t want to write for going
viral. It’s at odds with why I hope people come here, which is to
get intelligent perspective on security engineering and appsec. (We
also include company news.) I focus more on quality than I
do on scale, because I believe that quality will bring in the
readers who want to read. (I also aim for conciseness, and often
miss.)

Part of that aim is that I don’t focus on reader metrics, and part
of not focusing on reader metrics is that they lie and those lies
would distort what I write. They lie because opens, scrolls to the
bottom, and the rest of it are correlates, not effects, of
thoughtful attention. If I make my point in the opener (as I
sometimes manage to do), people get value without scrolling to the
bottom. If we track that with javascript, it’s easy to start
writing to the metric and waste your time.

Another part of that is I don’t focus on viewer metrics when
accepting podcast invitations. The person who screens those looks
for thoughtful, interesting questions, and so I’ve discovered that
some were very small podcasts, but often by dedicated folks who
were thoughtful about what they were doing. I can get behind that.

Reader metrics are also a reason that everyone wants you to sign up
for their email. If I demonstrably have X readers, I can charge Y
for an ad, or get onto this podcast or that. Do those email
newsletters get delivered? (Probably not.) Are they read
carefully? Who knows. As Goodhart told us, “When a measure becomes
a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

So there’s no
catalog of our top ten posts last year. I haven’t looked, and plan
not to. Similarly, I’m going to reduce my engagement with gated
material this year. There’s a ~~blog~~ Medium post that I’m
seeing get a lot of references, and the author has set it to
Medium customers only. A fine choice, and I’m not going to bother
to login. Similarly, someone cited my work, and I might even have
an institutional login to AIAA. But the chain of redirects through
“OpenAthens” or “Institutional Login” or go to the UW library and
enter the DOI consumes a minute or more when you include
searching, temporarily allowing the tracking websites, the MFA
refreshes and the “checking that you’re logged into Cloudflare and Google”
captchas... All to push those metrics, all to feed the attention
machines.

Take control of what you read: Use RSS. If you prefer email, use a
mail provider who’ll give you consistent control of what makes it to
your inbox. Stop doomscrolling.

And if you publish, take control of how you publish. Make it easier
for readers to engage with your content. Syndicate through platforms
that give you valuable engagement. Be thoughtful about what you
value.

Your time is your most precious resource. Spend it wisely in 2026.

As I went through to edit this post, I got to
the line about “those lies would distort what I write.” I thought
about making that a pull quote to make the post more fun to read. It’s
insidious. (I also thought about removing the parentheticals.)
