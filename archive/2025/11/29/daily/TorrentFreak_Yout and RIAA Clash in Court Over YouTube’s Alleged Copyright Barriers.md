# Yout and RIAA Clash in Court Over YouTube’s Alleged Copyright Barriers

Is downloading a YouTube video a violation of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provision? That is the key question in the legal battle between stream-ripper Yout and the RIAA. Yout argues that because YouTube videos are freely accessible to anyone with a web browser, there are no restrictions. The RIAA counters that Yout is confusing the right to watch a stream with the right to download a copy of the music file.

The music group had previously used DMCA takedown notices to remove many of Yout’s links from Google’s search results. This had a significant impact on Yout’s advertising revenues, according to operator Johnathan Nader, who always believed he wasn’t breaking any laws.

In 2022, the district court [concluded](https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-thwarts-youts-attempt-to-declare-youtube-ripping-legal-221002/) that Yout had failed to show that it doesn’t circumvent YouTube’s technological protection measures. That rendered Yout’s defamation and business disparagement claims moot, but the legal battle was far from over.

## Yout.com Appeals

Yout’s operator did not give up. In 2023, Nader [appealed](https://torrentfreak.com/yout-com-reignites-riaa-stream-ripping-dispute-at-court-of-appeal-230203/) in the belief that YouTube rippers do not violate the DMCA. The argument received backing from the [EFF and GitHub](https://torrentfreak.com/github-and-eff-back-youtube-ripper-in-legal-battle-with-the-riaa-230210/) in their supporting amicus briefs.

The RIAA disagreed, [countering](https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-counters-yout-com-stream-ripper-brief-at-u-s-court-of-appeal-230505/) that Yout is an “illicit stream-ripping service” that effectively allows people to “bypass YouTube’s technological restrictions” that prevent downloading of works streamed through YouTube. As such, the service violates the DMCA, a position [supported](https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-alliance-backs-riaa-in-key-youtube-ripper-lawsuit-230515/) by the Copyright Alliance.

One of the key issues in this dispute is whether [YouTube’s “rolling cipher”](https://torrentfreak.com/deciphering-youtubes-rolling-cypher-in-your-browser-is-a-piece-of-cake-201030/) is a technological measure designed to control *access to* or *copying of* copyrighted works. The difference between access and copying has become a key point of contention in a new AI twist.

## AI Relevance: Access Controls vs. Copy Controls

Last month, AI music companies Suno and Udio filed an amicus brief at the Court of Appeals, alerting it to an alleged error the Connecticut district court made in its original ruling against Yout.

Suno and Udio, who were both sued by music companies, argued that the lower court’s ruling failed to recognize the difference between “access controls” and “copy controls”. This is crucial, they noted, as Congress explicitly separated these two copyright controls to enable fair use.

Congress recognized that to claim fair use, people have to copy something first. If the law were to prohibit the circumvention of copying restrictions, fair use would be effectively outlawed as well.

– **Circumventing access controls is prohibited** under 17 U.S.C. § 1201

– **Circumventing copy controls is NOT explicitly prohibited** under 17 U.S.C. § 1201.

For AI companies like Suno and Udio, the legal distinction between access controls and copy controls is not just a technicality. It’s the difference between having a viable fair use defense and being automatically liable for massive damages.

If the court rules that YouTube’s “rolling cipher” is an access control, Suno and Udio effectively lose their ability to argue fair use for the data they’ve scraped by accessing YouTube.

## Yout Cites New Paywall Defense

Last week, Yout’s legal team told the Court of Appeals that they wholeheartedly agree with Suno and Udio. In a response brief, they note that the AI companies have it precisely right.

Yout’s lawyer, Evan Fray-Witzer, once again stresses that YouTube doesn’t have any access controls, as it is obvious that anyone with a web browser can watch videos on the platform.

“The District Court’s opinion ignores the simple fact […] that the videos displayed on YouTube are freely available to ‘anyone who requests them’ without a paywall, encryption, password, or decryption,” Yout’s response reads.

To back this up, Yout points to a very recent ruling: the July 2025 decision in a lawsuit between Emmerich Newspapers and the news aggregator Particle Media, better known as NewsBreak.

In that case, a court ruled that the news aggregator didn’t violate the DMCA when its bots stripped “paywall code” from the newspaper’s website. The judge concluded that, because the newspaper’s server voluntarily sent the full article text to the bot (including the paywall code), the bot didn’t “break in” to an access-controlled area. Instead, it simply “used” the data it was given in a way the publisher disliked.

Yout stresses that the same logic applies to its interaction with YouTube. Because YouTube sends audio and video data to anyone who visits the site without requiring a password, Yout argues the “gates are up,” making it legally impossible to “circumvent” an access control.

## RIAA: You Can Watch, But You Can’t Touch

The RIAA also filed a brief in response to Suno and Udio, urging the Court of Appeals to reject the arguments from these AI companies.

RIAA’s central argument is that YouTube’s “rolling cipher” is designed to distinguish between two different things: access to a performance (the stream) and access to the work (the fixed digital file).

The RIAA agrees that YouTube allows people to view the stream, but they argue that the rolling cipher is designed to control access to the underlying fixed file.

“Amici’s argument conflates access to a ‘performance’ of a work with access to the ‘work’ itself,” the RIAA writes. In bypassing the cipher to download the file, stream-rippers such as Yout can access something YouTube never intended to give: a permanent digital copy.

While YouTube allows the public to view the performances without restriction, it uses the “rolling cipher” to restrict direct access to the underlying file. By modifying this cipher, Yout bypasses a valid access control, the RIAA notes.

## The YouTube Whisperers

Both sides clearly have an opinion on how and why YouTube implemented its rolling cipher code. However, YouTube itself is not a party to the lawsuit, nor has it filed an amicus brief to explain its technology.

Yout’s lawyer previously argued that there is a legal vacuum where the court has to guess YouTube’s intentions, instead of moving the case forward so YouTube itself can be heard.

“There is a question as to what YouTube intended with these measures. We don’t know because YouTube isn’t here,” Yout’s lawyer argued [in a previous hearing](https://torrentfreak.com/appeals-court-hears-riaa-and-y...
