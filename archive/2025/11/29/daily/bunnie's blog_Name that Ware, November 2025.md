This one is hopefully a bit easier to guess compared to last month’s ware! Pictured is just one board of a two board set, but the second board is a bit too much of a dead give-away so it’s been omitted. Thanks to [Sam](https://samch.in/) for thinking on her feet and snatching this board so that it could be donated to the contest!

   My guess would be a programmer for RFID cards/tokens. The ANT trace seems like an NFC antenna. The microswitch seems like it would physically detect if something like a card is placed against this, and as far as I know that is not common for readers, but that might be useful for detecting (or speed up detection for) uninitialized cards

   Looks like a board from an RFID lock reader. Tamper switch, JTAG header, unpopulated relay (and NO/NC contacts) to directly open a door strike without using an external controller, big integrated antenna, LED that lights up to show card read status…

   Looks like the PCB of a RFID-controlled door lock. Clues:

   – The 13.560 MHz oscillator
   – The ANT trace is likely an NFC antenna, as johslarsen noticed
   – The N.O. | COM | N.C. is probably Normally Open, Common, Normally Closed output to power a door lock
   – I don’t think that the microswitch is there to detect if an empty card is being pressed against the reader. I think it’s there as anti-tamper protection.
