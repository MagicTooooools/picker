Fighting for a free internet requires collective action. And the Tor Project is proud to be in the company of many likeminded organizations that work to maintain and restore access to trustworthy information for millions of people globally. Tune into the **State of the Onion: Community Day** [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZVk0kb7lhw) to hear directly from other members of the Tor community about their efforts to defend your privacy, protect you from surveillance and censorship, and how they are making an impact in 2025.

### Community Day - December 10, 2025, 17:00 UTCÂ

Join us on Day 2 as organizations from the wider Tor ecosystem discuss how they are providing privacy preserving technologies on the most trusted anonymity network. Here is a little preview of who to expect:Â

* **[OONI](https://ooni.org/)**: Working to advance transparency of internet censorship globally by collecting and publishing empirical network measurement data that serves as open evidence for research, advocacy, and litigation.
* **[The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/)**: Keeping mobile users connected to sites and apps they need in times of crisis, making design choices that prioritize users' physical security, and bringing "Kindness" to more platforms and users.
* **[Hushline](https://hushline.app/)**: Providing a safe way for whistleblowers to reach someone who can help-- with a focus on lawyers, journalists, and mental health professionals--while providing native Onion Services for high-risk sources.
* **[Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/)**: Looking at the challenges of building open-source tools that facilitate journalism in dangerous situations and the future of technology-enabled whistleblowing.
* **And many more to come...**

### How to watch

We couldn't do the work we're sharing at this year's State of the Onion without your support! This event is part of our [year-end fundraising campaign](https://blog.torproject.org/2025-fundraiser-donations-matched/). You can fund the Tor Project's work by [making a donation](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp6-yec2025) today.

Right now, if you make a donation to Tor, your donation will be matched by a generous supporter. That means if you donate $25, they will also donate $25 --- effectively doubling your gift and raising $50 for our teams.

Tor is upgrading its relay encryption algorithm for improved
