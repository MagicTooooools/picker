# Fake LinkedIn jobs trick Mac users into downloading Flexible Ferret malware

Posted: November 26, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

[Researchers](https://www.jamf.com/blog/flexibleferret-malware-continues-to-adapt/) have discovered a new attack targeting Mac users. It lures them to a fake job website, then tricks them into downloading malware via a bogus software update.

The attackers pose as recruiters and contact people via LinkedIn, encouraging them to apply for a role. As part of the application process, victims are required to record a video introduction and upload it to a special website.

On that website, visitors are tricked into installing a so-called update for FFmpeg media file-processing software which is, in reality, a backdoor. This method, known as the [Contagious Interview campaign](https://www.validin.com/blog/inside_dprk_fake_job_platform/), points to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Contagious Interview is an illicit job-platform campaign that targets job seekers with social engineering tactics. The actors impersonate well-known brands and actively recruit software developers, artificial intelligence researchers, cryptocurrency professionals, and candidates for both technical and non-technical roles.

The malicious website first asks the victim to complete a “job assessment.” When the applicant tries to record a video, the site claims that access to the camera or microphone is blocked. To “fix” it, the site prompts the user to download an “update” for FFmpeg.

Much like in [ClickFix attacks](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/atomic-stealer-now-using-clipboard-hijacking-to-target-macs/), victims are given a curl command to run in their Terminal. That command downloads a script which ultimately installs a backdoor onto their system. A “decoy” application then appears with a window styled to look like Chrome, telling the user Chrome needs camera access. Next, a window prompts for the user’s password, which, once entered, is sent to the attackers via Dropbox.

The end-goal of the attackers is Flexible Ferret, a multi-stage macOS malware chain active since early 2025. Here’s what it does and why it’s dangerous for affected Macs and users:

After stealing the password, the malware immediately establishes persistence by creating a LaunchAgent. This ensures it reloads every time the user logs in, giving attackers long-term, covert access to the infected Mac.

FlexibleFerret’s core payload is a Go-based backdoor. It enables attackers to:

* Collect detailed information about the victim’s device and environment
* Upload and download files
* Execute shell commands (providing full system control)
* Extract Chrome browser profile data
* Automate additional credential and data theft

Basically, this means the infected Mac becomes part of a remote-controlled botnet with direct access for cybercriminals.

## How to stay safe

While this campaign targets Mac users, that doesn’t mean Windows users are safe. The same lure is used, but the attacker is [known](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/dprk-hackers-use-clickfix-to-deliver.html) to use the information stealer InvisibleFerret against Windows users.

The best way to stay safe is ...
