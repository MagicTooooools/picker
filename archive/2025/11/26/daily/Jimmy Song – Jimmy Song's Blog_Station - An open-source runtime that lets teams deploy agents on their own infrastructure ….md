# Station

An open-source runtime that lets teams deploy agents on their own infrastructure with full control.

Author:

## Detailed Introduction

Station is an open-source runtime designed to let teams deploy and run agents on their own infrastructure while retaining full control over data, network, and execution environments. It abstracts agent lifecycle management, task scheduling, secrets and access control, and integrations with model and retrieval services into a configurable runtime suitable for enterprise delivery and compliance.

## Main Features

* Local deployment: Run in private clusters or edge environments to avoid sending sensitive data to third-party clouds.
* Lifecycle management: Start, stop, update, and version agents reliably.
* Integration points: Built-in adapters for model providers, vector databases and retrieval components to compose RAG and multimodal workflows.
* Security and governance: Secrets isolation, network policies, and audit capabilities to meet enterprise compliance.

## Use Cases

* Enterprise assistants: Deploy internal customer service or knowledge assistants that keep sensitive knowledge on-premises.
* Automated operations: Use executable agents as part of ops orchestration for monitoring, incident response, and automated remediation.
* Industry-specific agents: Finance, healthcare and other regulated domains that require data sovereignty and controlled deployment.

## Technical Features

* Language & platform: Implemented in Go for performance and low resource overhead.
* Extensibility: Modular plugin points support multiple model backends and retrieval layers.
* Operability: Integrates with container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) and CI/CD pipelines, with observability and logging support.
* Open-source license: Apache-2.0, enabling enterprise evaluation and extension.
