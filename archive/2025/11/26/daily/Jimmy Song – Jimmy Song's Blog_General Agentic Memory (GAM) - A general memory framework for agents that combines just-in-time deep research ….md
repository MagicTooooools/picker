## Detailed Introduction

General Agentic Memory (GAM) is a general-purpose memory framework for agents that follows a Just-in-Time (JIT) memory optimization paradigm. At runtime, GAM performs deep research to retrieve and synthesize high-utility context from session data, using a dual-agent design — Memorizer and Researcher — to build structured memories and iteratively retrieve and refine context for downstream agents. The framework demonstrates strong performance on long-context benchmarks.

## Main Features

* JIT memory optimization: retrieve and synthesize context at runtime to reduce up-front processing.
* Dual-agent architecture: Memorizer constructs memory events while Researcher performs iterative retrieval and summarization.
* Modular design: pluggable retrievers, embedding generators and model backends for flexible integration.
* Reproducible evaluation: includes an evaluation suite to reproduce LoCoMo, HotpotQA, RULER and NarrativeQA results.

## Use Cases

* Agent memory enhancement: provide long-term, context-aware memory for conversational and autonomous agents.
* Research & benchmarking: reproduce paper experiments and evaluate memory strategies.
* Hybrid deployment: run locally or in-cloud for research and production scenarios.

## Technical Features

* Retrieval strategies: support dense vector retrieval and BM25 hybrid approaches.
* Cross-model compatibility: works with cloud LLMs and local runtimes (e.g., OpenAI, vLLM).
* Evaluation-driven: unified CLI and scripts for running benchmarks and reproducing results.
* Open-source license: MIT license for research reuse and engineering extension.
