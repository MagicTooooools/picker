### I Like Old Things

I’ve always been fond of old things. I feel that an object truly becomes your own only after you’ve used it for a long time and it bears your marks. That’s why durable, long-lasting items really appeal to me.

For example, a Zippo lighter, a G-Shock watch, and a Lacoste shirt my brother gave me that I’ve been wearing since middle school. It’s been through the washing machine countless times, and the quality is still top-notch.

A few days ago, I came across an article in The Guardian about a famous French glass brand, Duralex, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, and how many people came to their aid. This story really touched me.

### About Duralex

Duralex is an old French brand, established in 1945. They are most famous for their tempered glass cups and bowls, which are particularly sturdy, heat-resistant, and shatterproof. That’s why they are widely used in many French homes, schools, and cafes.

The most famous is the “Picardie” glass, which has a simple, beautiful design and is super durable. For me, things with a sense of history and practicality have a real charm.

### Unboxing

I bought an amber-colored one on JD.com for 20 yuan. You can see the picture on my Instagram.

After receiving it, the color is indeed great. The sticker on the cup came off easily without leaving any residue, which is a big plus. It also feels comfortable to hold. The production date was printed on the box, which felt thoughtful.

Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase. I feel like this cup will last a long time, which is great.

### Some Thoughts

In this era, things are thrown away as soon as they break, and the pace of replacement is too fast. Buying a cup that can be used for a long time is, for me, a small act of “rebellion.”

This cup is new now, but I hope that many years from now, it will become an “old thing,” bearing the marks of my use, and holding my life and time. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase and feel that this cup will be with me for a long time.
