## Detailed Introduction

Free LLM API resources is a community-maintained GitHub repository that aggregates API-accessible LLM providers and gateway platforms (such as OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Cloudflare Workers AI). The project organizes entries as a list with notes on free quotas, rate limits, available models and access links, helping developers quickly discover and compare low-cost options for experimentation and prototyping.

## Main Features

* Broad coverage: lists many providers and gateways that offer free access or trial credits.
* Practical metadata: records rate limits, model availability and direct links for quick onboarding.
* Community driven: updated via PRs to capture new access channels and changes.
* Integration friendly: many entries point to direct API endpoints or gateway URLs for easy integration.

## Use Cases

* Prototyping: low-cost access options for quickly validating model capabilities.
* Teaching & labs: reproducible API references for classroom or workshop exercises.
* Comparison: evaluate latency, quotas and availability across multiple providers.

## Technical Features

* Documentation-first repository: organized as Markdown lists, with some parts generated by scripts for scalability.
* Multi-platform: covers OpenRouter, Cloudflare, Vercel, Hugging Face and more.
* Contribution model: community PRs accepted; includes usage examples and quickstart pointers.
