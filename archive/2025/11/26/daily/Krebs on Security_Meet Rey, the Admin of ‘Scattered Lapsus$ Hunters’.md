# Meet Rey, the Admin of ‘Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters’

November 26, 2025

[15 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/meet-rey-the-admin-of-scattered-lapsus-hunters/#comments)

A prolific cybercriminal group that calls itself “**Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters**” has dominated headlines this year by regularly stealing data from and publicly mass extorting dozens of major corporations. But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for “Rey,” the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.

Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLSH) is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups — [**Scattered Spider**](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=scattered+spider), [**LAPSUS$**](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=lapsus%24) and [**ShinyHunters**](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=shiny+hunters). Members of these gangs hail from many of the same chat channels on the **Com**, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.

In May 2025, SLSH members launched [a social engineering campaign](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/shinyhunters-wage-broad-corporate-extortion-spree/) that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal. The group later launched a data leak portal that threatened to publish the internal data of three dozen companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including **Toyota**, **FedEx**, **Disney/Hulu**, and **UPS**.

Last week, the SLSH Telegram channel featured an offer to recruit and reward “insiders,” employees at large companies who agree to share internal access to their employer’s network for a share of whatever ransom payment is ultimately paid by the victim company.

SLSH has solicited insider access previously, but their latest call for disgruntled employees started making the rounds on social media at the same time news broke that the cybersecurity firm **Crowdstrike** had fired an employee for [allegedly sharing screenshots of internal systems](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/crowdstrike-fires-suspicious-insider-who-passed-information-to-hackers/) with the hacker group (Crowdstrike said their systems were never compromised and that it has turned the matter over to law enforcement agencies).

The Telegram server for the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters has been attempting to recruit insiders at large companies.

Members of SLSH have traditionally used other ransomware gangs’ encryptors in attacks, including malware from ransomware affiliate programs like ALPHV/BlackCat, Qilin, RansomHub, and DragonForce. But last week, SLSH announced on its Telegram channel [the release of their own ransomware-as-a-service operation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/meet-shinysp1d3r-new-ransomware-as-a-service-created-by-shinyhunters/) called **ShinySp1d3r**.

The individual responsible for releasing the ShinySp1d3r ransomware offering is a core SLSH member who goes by the handle “Rey” and who is currently one of just three administrators of the SLSH Telegram channel. Previously, Rey was an [administrator](https://web.archive.org/web/20241201110456/https%3A//twitter.com/ReyXBF/status/1863177457450573835) of the data leak website for **Hellcat**, a ransomware group that surfaced in late 2024 and was involved in attacks on companies including **Schneider Electric**, **Telefonica**, and **Orange Romania**.

A recent, slightly redacted screenshot of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters Telegram channel description, showing Rey as one of three administrators.

Also in 2024, Rey would take over as administrator of the [most recent incarnation of BreachForums](https://web.archive.org/web/20241129001040/https%3A//twitter.com/ReyXBF/status/1862288027579801821), an English-language cybercrime forum whose domain names have been seized on multiple occasions by the FBI and/or by international authorities. In April 2025, Rey [posted on Twitter/X](https://web.archive.org/web/20250418062459/https%3A//twitter.com/ReyXBF/status/1913116530658705661) about another FBI seizure of BreachForums.

On October 5, 2025, the FBI [announced](https://x.com/FBI/status/1977464345651982491) it had once again seized the domains associated with BreachForums, which it described as a major criminal marketplace used by ShinyHunters and others to traffic in stolen data and facilitate extortion.

“This takedown removes access to a key hub used by these actors to monetize intrusions, recruit collaborators, and target victims across multiple sectors,” the FBI said.

Incredibly, Rey would make a series of critical operational security mistakes last year that provided multiple avenues to ascertain and confirm his real-life identity and location. Read on to learn how it all unraveled for Rey.

## WHO IS REY?

According to the cyber intelligence firm **Intel 471**, Rey was an active user on various **BreachForums** reincarnations over the past two years, authoring more than 200 posts between February 2024 and July 2025. Intel 471 says Rey previously used the handle “**Hikki-Chan**” on BreachForums, where their first post shared data allegedly stolen from the **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** (CDC).

In that February 2024 post about the CDC, Hikki-Chan says they could be reached at the Telegram username **@wristmug**. In May 2024, @wristmug posted in a Telegram group chat called “Pantifan” a copy of an extortion email they said they received that included their email address and password.

The message that @wristmug cut and pasted appears to have been part of an [automated email scam](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/) that claims it was sent by a hacker who has compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. These missives threaten to release the video to all your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom, and they typically reference a real password the recipient has used previously.

“Noooooo,” the @wristmug account wrote in mock horror after posting a screenshot of the scam message. “I must be done guys.”

A message posted to Telegram by Rey/@wristmug.

In posting their screenshot, @wristmug redacted the username portion of the email address referenced in the body of the scam message. However, they did not redact their previously-used password, and they left the domain portion of their email address (@proton.me) visible in the screenshot.

## O5TDEV

Searching on @wristmug’s rather unique 15-character password in the breach tracking service **Spycloud** finds it is known to have been used by just one email address: **cybero5tdev@proton.me**. According to Spycloud, those credentials were exposed at least twice in early 2024 when this user’s device was infected with an infostealer trojan that siphoned all of its stored usernames,...
