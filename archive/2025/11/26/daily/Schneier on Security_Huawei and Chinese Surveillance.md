## Huawei and Chinese Surveillance

This quote is from [*House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company*](https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/book/9780593544631).

> “Long before anyone had heard of Ren Zhengfei or Huawei, Wan Runnan had been China’s star entrepreneur in the 1980s, with his company, the Stone Group, touted as “China’s IBM.” Wan had believed that economic change could lead to political change. He had thrown his support behind the pro-democracy protesters in 1989. As a result, he had to flee to France, with an arrest warrant hanging over his head. He was never able to return home. Now, decades later and in failing health in Paris, Wan recalled something that had happened one day in the late 1980s, when he was still living in Beijing.
>
> Local officials had invited him to dinner.
>
> This was unusual. He was usually the one to invite officials to dine, so as to curry favor with the show of hospitality. Over the meal, the officials told Wan that the Ministry of State Security was going to send agents to work undercover at his company in positions dealing with international relations. The officials cast the move to embed these minders as an act of protection for Wan and the company’s other executives, a security measure that would keep them from stumbling into unseen risks in their dealings with foreigners. “You have a lot of international business, which raises security issues for you. There are situations that you don’t understand,” Wan recalled the officials telling him. “They said, ‘We are sending some people over. You can just treat them like regular employees.'”
>
> Wan said he knew that around this time, state intelligence also contacted other tech companies in Beijing with the same request. He couldn’t say what the situation was for Huawei, which was still a little startup far to the south in Shenzhen, not yet on anyone’s radar. But Wan said he didn’t believe that Huawei would have been able to escape similar demands. “That is a certainty,” he said.
>
> “Telecommunications is an industry that has to do with keeping control of a nation’s lifeline…and actually in any system of communications, there’s a back-end platform that could be used for eavesdropping.”
>
> It was a rare moment of an executive lifting the cone of silence surrounding the MSS’s relationship with China’s high-tech industry. It was rare, in fact, in any country. Around the world, such spying operations rank among governments’ closest-held secrets. When Edward Snowden had exposed the NSA’s operations abroad, he’d ended up in exile in Russia. Wan, too, might have risked arrest had he still been living in China.

@ ALL,

This sounds damming,

> *“He couldn’t say what the situation was for Huawei, which was still a little startup far to the south in Shenzhen, not yet on anyone’s radar. But Wan said he didn’t believe that Huawei would have been able to escape similar demands.”*

But it’s not factual, it’s at best opinion from something that happened a long time ago.

Now something factual, Huawei set up a technology center in the UK which allowed GCHQ to have full access to design documents through all aspects of the products to the finished and boxed units.

GCHQ looked and found nothing, they even contrary to agreement smuggled people from the NSA and other security agencies in to look things over.

They found nothing…

Now that means that either there was nothing to find or the Chinese Security people are way way more clever than the UK and US security agencies[1].

But as usual with the US, the politicians are happy to burn any other nations security methods, sources and assets if they think they can get more personal power from doing so… (and in Scooter Libbey’s case even burn US assets).

The problem was they found nothing for the politicians to rattle their sabers and bang the drum over.

So they just put a load of nonsense together and “tried to sell it as a bridge to nowhere”.

The US MSM as usual pumped up via “anonymous sources” and eventually the US Politicos had to resort to threatening allies to get them to stop using Chinese chips and equipment.

We see the same nonsense still in action from US Politicians… The simple fact is that it’s not about China but the US.

Back when Ronny Ragun and Mad Maggie Thatcher were in power they very very stupidly “Deregulated Capitalism”… And we are still suffering from this.

People rather foolishly believe that “the market is best” with only a “light touch”. The reality is that the capitalist way is in reality the way of monopoly and worse, especially when the product is “information”.

I’ve noted before that one of the reasons traditional markets of physical goods had limitations was “Distance Costs”. That is the further you move a physical object from the manufacturer to the customer the more it costs. This means that local manufacture has a competitive advantage against large corporates with one or at most two points of manufacture.

This limitation does not apply when the good are intangible “information objects”. Which means the marketplace gets badly skewed in favour of large corporations.

And this is before we start talking about the criminal and fraudulent activity of corporations done by well payed lobbyist entities.

So you the voter have no say in legislation to keep corporations under sensible control and stop them behaving in ways that bring all sorts of harms on to society.

The US and probably the West is about to go through another major recession thanks to corporate begaviour and there is no legislation in place that will stop it happening.

And the ordinary tax paying citizens are the ones who will yet again have to bail the corporations out.

Cory Doctorow just recently wrote a piece on this actual issue as a follow on from “enshitification”,

[1] As we know from the NSA and the Dual EC-DRBG it is possible to hide things even from alleged experts.

Bruce, isn’t this standard in the West? I’ve heard similar stories from people ...
