# Greek Cybercrime Unit Shuts Down IPTV Pirates, 68 End Users Face Fines

A targeted action by Greek authorities has shut down an IPTV reselling operation, leading to the arrest of one individual and the referral of 68 end users for prosecution. The action marks a shift in Greek law enforcement’s approach to IPTV piracy, arriving on the back of a new law that provides for thousands of euros in fines for both sellers and users.

Early September, it was reported that a man from Sparta faces prosecution and a fine of up to 6,000 euros for two IPTV piracy offenses.

The suspect, reportedly a café owner, was targeted at his workplace on a Saturday, allegedly in front of customers. One told local media that they believed that complaints of the café engaging in “unfair competition” preceded the untimely visit.

## New Operation Much Larger in Scale

The Cybercrime Prosecution Directorate launched their operation in the early hours of November 19. The Athens-based unit targeted a network that sold illicit access to premium pay-TV via IPTV subscriptions.

The raid, conducted on Santorini, one of the Cyclades islands, resulted in the arrest of a 48-year-old, who, from police reports, appears to be a reseller for a larger network. Customers were reportedly charged €50 for 3 months subscription or €100 for 6 months. Sales and management were handled by the 48-year-old via an online platform known as a ‘panel’, while remote and in-person support were available as part of the service.

The impact of the raid was visible on the islands, locals said. According to a local [report](https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/1730512/enas-48hronos-o-egefalos-tou-kuklomatos-peirateias-sti-sadorini-dikografia-kai-gia-allous-68/), hundreds of users in hotels, cafes, and residences on Santorini and beyond, found themselves suddenly without access to cheap TV. Apparently few areas were untouched by the disruption, such was local reliance on illegal streams.

## Arrest and Seizure of Evidence

The identity of the main suspect has not been released but as the focus of an early prominent case, facing charges of commercial exploitation of illegal IPTV subscriptions, the outcome is unlikely to be especially pleasant.

During a search of the suspect’s home, police seized a modified IPTV device configured to illegally receive subscription channels from at least two unnamed companies, a laptop computer, a mobile phone, and €4,820 in cash. The seized digital evidence has been sent to the Criminal Investigations Directorate for laboratory analysis.

## End Users Face an Uncertain Wait

The most significant tactical aspect of the operation may have been the choice of target and in particular, their customer base. If the reports are true, many may have operated from various commercial premises, such as hotels and cafes. This means they too could face [significant fines](https://opi.gr/en/library/law-2121-1993/#a66) of up to 5,000 euros, way above the 750 euro penalties reserved for individual users.

Almost 70 targets is significant too, a number exceeded only in Italy, where people are [fined by the state](https://torrentfreak.com/italy-fines-over-2200-pirate-iptv-subscribers-in-new-crackdown-250516/) before their details are shared with [DAZN](https://torrentfreak.com/dazn-letters-to-iptv-pirates-demand-e500-and-full-compliance-in-7-days-or-else-251009/) and Serie A who request damages on top.
