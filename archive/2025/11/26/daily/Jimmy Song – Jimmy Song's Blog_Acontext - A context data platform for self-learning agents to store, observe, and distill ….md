# Acontext

A context data platform for self-learning agents to store, observe, and distill experiences.

Author:

## Detailed Introduction

Acontext is a context data platform for self-learning agents that centralizes session context, task observations, and artifacts. It captures agent task traces and user feedback, distills experiences into long-term memory, and provides a local dashboard and CLI for developers to build an observation-and-learning loop. See the official documentation at
[Acontext Docs](https://docs.acontext.io/).

## Main Features

* Structured context storage: hierarchical Session, Space, and Artifact models for easy retrieval and management.
* Observability & metrics: task traces, success-rate dashboards, and diagnostic views for debugging agent behaviour.
* Experience distillation: converts SOPs and task outcomes into reusable skills and memories.
* Local and cloud deployment: `acontext` CLI, Docker presets and templates to speed up proofs-of-concept.

## Use Cases

* Agent products: provide centralized context and memory storage to improve multi-agent coordination and success rates.
* R&D and testing: reproduce task flows locally, analyse failures, and iterate strategies quickly.
* Enterprise deployment: run in controlled networks to meet compliance and data governance requirements.
* Education & prototyping: serve as a foundation for building agent demos and teaching examples.

## Technical Features

* Multi-language SDKs and templates: support for Go, Python, TypeScript integration templates.
* Extensible storage backends: disk and external object storage support for artifacts.
* Developer-friendly: example repositories, scaffolding templates, and comprehensive docs for integration.
* Open-source license: Apache-2.0 licensed for community adoption and contribution.
