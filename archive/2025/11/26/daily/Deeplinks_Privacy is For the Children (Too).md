*In the past few years, governments across the world have* [*rolled out different digital identification*](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/digital-id-isnt-everybody-and-thats-okay) *options, and now there are efforts encouraging online companies to implement identity and age verification requirements with digital ID in mind. This blog is the third in a short series that explains digital ID and the pending use case of age verification. Here, we cover alternative frameworks on age controls, updates on parental controls, and the importance of digital privacy in an increasingly hostile climate politically. You can read the first two posts* [*here*](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/zero-knowledge-proofs-alone-are-not-digital-id-solution-protecting-user-privacy)*, and* [*here*](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/verifying-trust-digital-id-still-incomplete)*.*

Here’s what we’re seeing:

* Scope creep is already occurring with various [website shutdowns](https://www.blocked.org.uk/osa-blocks) and excessive requests from various websites.
* Data is being handed to [age assurance providers with questionable privacy policies](https://withpersona.com/legal/privacy-policy).
* Older teenagers ([voting age is set to be 16](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/16-year-olds-to-be-given-right-to-vote-through-seismic-government-election-reforms) in the UK) are having their [ability to communicate](https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act) online blocked on various platforms.
* Adults aren’t able to use the internet to access content that is lawfully available to them if th...
