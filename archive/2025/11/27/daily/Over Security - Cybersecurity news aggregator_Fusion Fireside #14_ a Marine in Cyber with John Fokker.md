### Jump to

In the final Fusion Fireside episode of 2025, we sit down with **John Fokker**, Vice President of Threat Intelligence Strategy at **Trellix**. John’s impact on cybersecurity is remarkable: few people share insights as frequently and as clearly as he does. His experience and easy-going manner make complex dynamics understandable—and (dare we say) entertaining.

## From Marine Corps to Cybercrime Fighter

John’s career path is anything but ordinary. Starting in the **Dutch Marine Corps**, he transitioned to the **Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit**, where he spearheaded major cybercrime investigations and co-founded the **NoMoreRansom Project**—a global initiative that has helped countless victims recover from ransomware attacks without paying criminals.

## Leading Global Threat Intelligence

Today, John oversees a **50-strong team of analysts** spread across multiple time zones, collectively processing **hundreds of millions of malicious file detections every month**. His leadership philosophy is clear: **empower analysts to act decisively**. By decentralising decision-making, John ensures critical threats are flagged quickly, while maintaining close collaboration with law enforcement when legal boundaries come into play.

## Insights from the Fireside

During our conversation, John shared several standout perspectives:

* **Lessons from Law Enforcement**: Discipline and precision from his policing days underpin his approach to threat intelligence.
* **Generative AI’s Impact**: 2025 has seen AI reshape attack patterns, making detection and attribution more complex.
* **Black Basta Case**: A defining moment this year, highlighting the blurred lines between cybercrime and nation-state agendas.
* **Looking Ahead**: John warns of emerging threats in 2026 and urges CISOs to integrate threat intelligence deeply into fraud prevention workflows.

## Fraud in 2026: A New Battleground

John emphasised that the **threat landscape is increasingly converging with financial fraud**. Sophisticated ransomware groups and nation-state proxies are exploiting stolen identity data and payment systems, creating hybrid attacks that blur traditional boundaries. For fraud prevention teams, this means **threat intelligence is no longer optional**—it’s a critical layer for detecting patterns that signal coordinated campaigns, not just isolated fraud attempts.

## Why This Matters

As geopolitical tensions rise and cybercrime converges with nation-state interests, John’s experience offers a roadmap for security leaders navigating uncertainty. His advice? **Stay agile, empower your teams with information, and anticipate the unexpected.**
