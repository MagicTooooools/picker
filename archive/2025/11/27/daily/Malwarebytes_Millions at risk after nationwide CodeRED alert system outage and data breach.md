# Millions at risk after nationwide CodeRED alert system outage and data breach

Posted: November 27, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A nationwide cyberattack against the OnSolve CodeRED emergency notifications system has prompted cities and counties across the US to warn residents and advise them to change their passwords.

CodeRED is used by local governments to deliver fast, targeted alerts during severe weather, evacuations, missing persons, and other urgent events. Both the data breach and the service outage have serious implications for communities.

The OnSolve CodeRED system is a cloud-based platform used by city, county, and state agencies to send emergency alerts via voice calls, SMS, email, mobile app notifications, and national alerting systems. Because of the incident, some regions temporarily lost access to the system and had to rely on social media or other methods to reach the public.

To avoid confusion: CodeRED is not the same as the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which is the federal government-managed emergency notifications system. The CodeRED emergency notification system is a voluntary program where residents can sign up to receive notifications and emergency alerts affecting the city they live in.

## What’s happened?

Among the many affected municipalities, the City of Cambridge’s Emergency Communications, Police, and Fire Departments [issued an alert](https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/cambridgepolice/News/2025/11/communitynoticecyberattackagainstcodered) urging users to change their passwords, especially if they reused the same password elsewhere. Similar advisories have been published by towns and counties in multiple states as the scale of the attack became clear.

The City of University Park, Texas, also [warned](https://www.uptexas.org/312/Emergency-Notifications) residents:

> “As a precaution, we want to make residents aware of a recent cybersecurity incident involving the City’s third-party emergency alert system, CodeRED. We were notified that a cybercriminal group targeted the system, which caused disruption and may have compromised some user data. This incident did not affect any City systems or services and remains isolated to the CodeRED software.”

The cause is [reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/onsolve-codered-cyberattack-disrupts-emergency-alert-systems-nationwide/) a ransomware attack claimed by the INC Ransom group. The group posted screenshots that appear to show stolen customer data, including email addresses and associated clear-text passwords.

The INC Ransom group also published part of the alleged ransom negotiation, suggesting that Crisis24 (the provider behind CodeRED) initially offered $100,000, later increasing the offer to $150,000, which INC rejected.

The incident forced Crisis24 to shut down its legacy environment and rebuild the system in a new, isolated infrastructure. Some regions, such as Douglas County, Colorado, have [terminated](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/law-enforcement-agencies-reevaluate-contracts-with-codered-after-data-breach) their CodeRED contracts following the outage.

## **Why this matters**

Cyberattacks happen, and data breaches are not always preventable. But storing your subscriber database—including passwords in clear text—seems rathe...
