In late September, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-digital-id-scheme-to-be-rolled-out-across-uk) his government’s plans to introduce a new digital ID scheme in the country to take effect before the end of the Parliament (no later than August 2029). The scheme will, [according to](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/keir-starmer-prime-minister-support-ids-barclays-b2851104.html) the Prime Minister, “cut the [faff](https://www.lexicallab.com/2017/11/word-of-the-day-faff/)” in proving people’s identities by creating a virtual ID on personal devices with information like people’s name, date of birth, nationality or residency status, and photo to verify their right to live and work in the country.

This is the latest example of a government creating a new digital system that is fundamentally incompatible with a privacy-protecting and human rights-defending democracy. This past year alone, we’ve seen [federal agencies](https://www.notus.org/technology/digital-drivers-licenses-biden-supercharge-transition) across the United States explore digital IDs to prevent fraud, the Transportation Security Administration accepting “[Digital passport IDs](https://blog.google/products/google-pay/google-wallet-update-september-2024/)” in Android, and [states](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/you-can-now-add-your-hawaii-driver-s-license-state-id-to-your-phone-here-s-how/ar-AA1pBmO3) contracting with mobile driver’s license providers (mDL). And [as we’ve said](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/digital-id-isnt-everybody-and-thats-okay) [many times](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/verifying-trust-digital-id-still-incomplete), digital ID is not for everyone and policymakers should ensure better access for people with or without a digital ID.

But instead, the UK is pushing forward with its plans to rollout digital ID in the country. Here’s three reasons why those policymakers have it wrong.

Digital ID allows the state to determine what you can access, not just verify who you are, by functioning as a key to opening—or closing—doors to essential services and experiences.

## Mission Creep

In his initial announcement, Starmer [stated](https://www.bbc....
