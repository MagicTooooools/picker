# How CVSS v4.0 works: characterizing and scoring vulnerabilities

Posted: November 28, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides software developers, testers, and security and IT professionals with a standardized way to assess vulnerabilities. You can use CVSS to assess the threat level of each vulnerability and then prioritize mitigation accordingly.

This article explains how the CVSS works, reviews its components, and describes why using a standardized process helps organizations assess vulnerabilities consistently.

A software vulnerability is any weakness in the codebase that can be exploited. Vulnerabilities can result from a variety of coding mistakes, including faulty logic, inadequate validation mechanisms, or lack of protection against buffer overflows. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt system operations.

## Why use a standardized scoring system?

With thousands of vulnerabilities disclosed each year, organizations need a way to prioritize which ones to address first. A standardized scoring system like CVSS helps teams:

* Compare vulnerabilities objectively
* Prioritize patching and mitigation efforts
* Communicate risk to stakeholders

CVSS is maintained by the [Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)](https://www.first.org)and is widely used by organizations and vulnerability databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov).

## CVSS v3.x metric groups

CVSS v3.x included three main metric groups:

1. **Base metrics:** Intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments.
2. **Temporal metrics:** Characteristics that change over time, but not among user environments.
3. **Environmental metrics:** Characteristics that are relevant and unique to a particular user’s environment.

## What’s new in CVSS v4.0?

The CVSS v4.0 update, released in late 2023, brings several significant changes and improvements over [previous versions (v3.0/v3.1)](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/how-cvss-works-characterizing-and-scoring-vulnerabilities/). Here’s what’s new and what’s changed:

1. **Expanded metric groups**

* **Base metrics** now include more granular distinctions, such as the new Attack Requirements (AT) metric and improved definitions for Privileges Required and User Interaction.
* **Threat metrics** are a new, optional metric group for capturing real-world exploitation and threat intelligence, helping to prioritize vulnerabilities based on active exploitation.
* **Supplemental metrics**, provide additional context—such as safety, automation, and recovery—to tailor scoring for specific industries or use cases.

2. **Refined scoring and terminology**

* **Attack Vector (AV)** introduced a clearer distinction between network, adjacent, local, and physical vectors, with improved definitions.
* **Attack Requirements (AT)** is introduced to capture conditions that must exist for successful exploitation, but are outside the attacker’s control.
* **Privileges Required (PR) and User Interaction (UI)** have been clarified and expanded to reflect modern attack scenarios.
* The scope is now called “vulnerable system,” providing more precise language about what is affected.

3. **Greater flexibility and customization**

* **Modular scoring** allows organizations to use the base, threat,...
