South Korean web giant Naver has had an interesting week, after it acquired a cryptocurrency exchange that the next day revealed it had suffered a serious cyberattack.

The fun started on Wednesday when Naver – which fills online niches served by Google, Yahoo and WhatsApp in other countries – [announcing](https://englishdart.fss.or.kr/dsbh001/main.do?rcpNo=20251127800001) its acquisition of Dunamu Corp, operator of a cryptocurrency exchange called Upbit.

Naver said acquiring Upbit would help to grow its financial services business, making the $10.27 billion stock swap deal a sound investment.
