French cloud outfit OVHcloud took another hit this week after GrapheneOS, a mobile operating system, said it was ditching the company's servers over concerns about France's approach to digital privacy.

The project [posted](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1993035936800584103) on X (formerly Twitter): "We no longer have any active servers in France and are continuing the process of leaving OVH."

"France isn't a safe country for open source privacy projects," the group explained. "They expect backdoors in encryption and for device access too. Secure devices and services are not going to be allowed.
