# SkyRL

A modular full-stack reinforcement learning (RL) library for large language models (LLMs), designed for long-horizon, real-world tasks.

Author:
NovaSky-AI

Since:
2025-04-22

[Visit Website](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [GitHub](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL)

## Detailed Introduction

SkyRL is a modular full-stack reinforcement learning (RL) library maintained by NovaSky-AI, focused on building scalable training and evaluation pipelines for large language models (LLMs). The project includes subpackages such as `skyrl-agent`, `skyrl-train`, and `skyrl-gym`, covering environment construction, training stack, agent layers, and deployment tooling to support reproducible research and engineering for long-horizon, real-world tasks.

## Main Features

* Modular components: split into training, agent, and environment libraries for easy composition and extension.
* Reproducible training pipelines: high-performance training stack and configurable experiment management for large-scale training.
* Rich environment suite: `skyrl-gym` provides tool-use environments implemented with the Gymnasium API.
* Open collaboration: Apache-2.0 license with comprehensive docs and examples for community contributions.

## Use Cases

* Training long-horizon agents for multi-turn tool-use and dialog tasks.
* Benchmarking and evaluating training algorithms and model performance in realistic environments.
* Teaching and research: reproducing experiments, building baselines, and tuning performance.

## Technical Features

* Implemented in Python and compatible with common deep-learning and distributed training toolchains, with a focus on performance and scalability.
* Command-line and configuration-driven interfaces enable running large-scale training on cloud or local clusters.
* Integrated monitoring and evaluation modules export experiment metrics to support reproducibility.
