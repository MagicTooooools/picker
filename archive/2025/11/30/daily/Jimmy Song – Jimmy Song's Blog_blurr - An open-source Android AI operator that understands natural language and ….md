## Detailed Introduction

blurr (project codename Panda) is an open-source Android personal AI operator that brings LLM-driven capabilities to mobile devices. Panda can perceive the screen, understand UI elements, and perform touch actions (tap, swipe, type) via the Android Accessibility Service to accomplish multi-step tasks such as automated replies, form filling, or cross-app flows. See the project homepage and README for demos and installation instructions (
[homepage](https://heypanda.org)).

## Main Features

* Intelligent UI automation: combines screen parsing with natural language understanding to carry out user-level actions.
* Local-first design: emphasizes device-side interaction and privacy, while allowing external model integrations as needed.
* Multimodal interaction: supports voice and text I/O with configurable local or cloud-based models.
* Community-driven: open-source repository with examples, demos, and contribution guidelines for extension.

## Use Cases

* Automating everyday phone tasks: send welcome messages, manage schedules, or auto-fill forms across apps.
* Accessibility assistance: enable users with mobility challenges to control apps via voice or concise commands.
* Research and prototyping: mobile agent prototype for multi-step tool use and agentic workflows.

## Technical Features

* Kotlin-based multi-agent architecture using Android Accessibility Service as the eyes-and-hands interface.
* High-level reasoning typically relies on configurable LLM backends; README provides sample configurations and quickstart steps.
* Gradle-built Android project with instructions for building and granting necessary accessibility permissions.
