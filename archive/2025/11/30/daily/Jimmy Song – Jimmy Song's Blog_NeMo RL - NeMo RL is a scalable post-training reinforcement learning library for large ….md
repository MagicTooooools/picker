## Detailed Introduction

NeMo RL (NVIDIA NeMo RL) is a scalable post-training reinforcement learning toolkit within the NVIDIA NeMo ecosystem, designed to provide high-performance, reproducible training and evaluation pipelines for large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models. The project supports multiple training and generation backends (DTensor, Megatron, vLLM), and offers modular components (e.g., `nemo_rl`, `examples`, `research`) for research and production deployment.

## Main Features

* Post-training support: includes GRPO, DPO, SFT, RM training paradigms with example configurations.
* Multi-backend compatibility: DTensor, Megatron Core, vLLM, and more for efficient training and generation.
* Extensible architecture: modular design to integrate custom environments, algorithms, and parallelism strategies.
* Enterprise documentation and examples: comprehensive docs and practical guides for cluster deployment and performance tuning.

## Use Cases

* Reinforcement fine-tuning and post-training on large models to improve performance in multi-turn tasks and tool-use scenarios.
* Running large-scale experiments on clusters or cloud, leveraging Megatron or DTensor for long sequences and large models.
* Research and education: reproduce experiments, compare algorithms, and run performance benchmarks.

## Technical Features

* Implemented in Python and compatible with common deep-learning toolchains, supporting advanced parallelisms (TP/PP/CP/SP/FSDP).
* Integrates Ray for scheduling and isolation, enabling multi-environment parallel training and resource isolation.
* Provides command-line and configuration-driven interfaces, with example scripts for quickstart and reproducibility.
