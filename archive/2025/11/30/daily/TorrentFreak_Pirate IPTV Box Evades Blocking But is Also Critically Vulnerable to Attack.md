# Pirate IPTV Box Evades Blocking But is Also Critically Vulnerable to Attack

Following Amazon's announcement that it won't allow the new Firestick to become a piracy free-for-all, some people are seeking out new devices to bridge the gap. Offering lifetime access to movies, TV shows and live sports, an already popular device that claims to evade site-blocking measures may seem like the perfect fit. Unfortunately, mandatory free extras include critical security issues and potential exposure to copyright lawsuits.

Described by the MPA, Premier League and other rightsholders as a priority piracy threat, a set-top box available to buy right now on popular markets, initially sounds like an attractive buy.

Manufactured in China, EVPAD TV boxes look fairly unremarkable, and with an Android 7.0 operating system under the hood, they are. When purchased with a cheap ‘lifetime’ subscription, with installable apps providing access to all the content most people will ever need, looks become less important.

However, a look under the hood reveals that the trade-off between content and privacy cannot be ignored.

## Researchers Investigate EVPAD

Android-based EVPAD devices provide access to a huge library of infringing movies, TV shows, and live TV, sourced from countries including Canada, Taiwan, the UK, and the United States, among others. As a result, major rightsholders have regularly [reported EVPAD](https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-highlights-rapidly-expanding-hydra-sites-as-an-emerging-piracy-problem/) and similar devices to the USTR’s Notorious Markets review.

A team of researchers at Korea University took an interest in the EVPAD ‘3p’ and ’10p’ devices when considering what type of anti-piracy measures might be effective against device-specific apps, operating within closed, subscription-based networks.

In this case, the EVPAD website advises buyers of the ‘3p’ device to download two apps from a third party website. ‘StarLive’ and ‘StarVod’ provide access to live TV broadcasts and VOD content, respectively. For the ’10p’ device, a single app called ‘StarV10’ is sufficient and in all cases, installation is simplicity itself.

“Interestingly, during the installation process from such unknown sources, the service applications are installed seamlessly without requiring any additional user interaction or explicit permissions,” the researchers report.

“Upon further inspection, we found that the global system setting for package installation from non-market sources (install\_non\_market\_apps) was set to 1, indicating that side-loading from unknown sources is universally permitted on this Android 7-based device.”

For regular buyers, zero control over permissions should’ve been an immediate red flag. For the researchers, the secrets of obfuscated source code were still to be discovered.

## “Streaming is Safer Than Torrents”

Since regular streaming is a process of consumption and the law tends to view supply more seriously, the theory that streaming is safer than torrents usually finds solid ground.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that streaming pirated content is legal, but in a client/server streaming scenario, obtaining evidence of downloading meets technical challenges that aren’t easily overcome. In contrast, BitTorrent users upload by default, which makes evidence of a more serious offense comparatively easy to obtain.

When people buy an EVPAD TV box, many will expect to ‘stream’ pirated content to the device. While that may be a part of the process, the reality is less straightforward.

## A Hybrid Network

The researchers at Korea University found that EVPAD devices initially communicate with centralized servers, which manage authentication, various updates, and the all-important content lists. Once obtained, EVPAD devices use that information to join a *BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer (P2P) network*, in which unwitting downloaders become simultaneous uploaders, or as they say in court, *unlicensed distributors of infringing content*.

StarLive uses the ‘[libtvcore](https://github.com/binstreamio/tvbus.android)‘ library to establish connections with other EVPAD devices, enabling real-time data sharing among peers, including the distribution of live TV broadcasts.

*Under the Hood*

![evpad-dia1](https://torrentfreak.com/images/evpad-dia1.png)

When a user of StarVod selects a video to watch, the system identifies a corresponding .torrent file and HTTP file server. Encrypted using XOR, the .torrent file is decrypted by the libp2ptrans library then used to perform standard BitTorrent functions, with a tracker providing a list of available peers.

“Simultaneously, the user engages in both P2P communication with other peers and HTTP communication with the file server delivering the selected VoD title. This dual approach ensures both downloading and streaming, but in practice, HTTP streaming via a dedicated file server significantly enhances service availability and playback speed, often playing a major role in video streaming,” the researchers note.

## Hybrid Network Complicates Blocking

This hybrid approach to networking complicates blocking efforts. While blocking certain domains would prevent service updates, that may not necessarily disrupt the P2P network.

In the event that the source of content becomes unavailable, the researchers say that data broadcasting nodes in the P2P network provide a fallback mechanism by acting as servers within the ‘swarm’. For video-on-demand (VoD) content, the system utilizes P2P but when necessary, HTTP is used to reach servers operating as Content Delivery Networks.

“[These servers] distribute torrent files and video content, and the presence of multiple similar domains suggests that they are designed to quickly circumvent domain blocks. Additionally, there are domains and IP addresses for Trackers to facilitate torrent-based communication,” the researchers add.

After manipulating IDs used to identify content categories, the researchers obtained all VOD lists from the servers above, which together identified 24,934 pieces of video content. That included 1,052 movies and TV shows in the ‘Nflix’ category alone.

## Building Resilience Introduced Weakness

No system is completely bulletproof, and this one is no exception. In theory, the decentralized nature of the P2P network makes the system more difficult to shut down. In practice, it also introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited to disrupt the service.

The researchers discovered two vulnerabilities. Using the Android emulator [NoxPlayer](https://www.bignox.com/) to mimic an authenticated EVPAD device, the first allowed them to bypass authentication. This enabled content to be viewed from around the world, without a subscription, with the potential for “unlimited replication.”

While the first vulner...
