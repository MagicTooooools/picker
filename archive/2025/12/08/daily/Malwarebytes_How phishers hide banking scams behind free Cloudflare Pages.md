# How phishers hide banking scams behind free Cloudflare Pages

![send money Telegram](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/send_money_telegram.png?w=1200)

During a recent investigation, we uncovered a phishing operation that combines free hosting on developer platforms with compromised legitimate websites to build convincing banking and insurance login portals. These fake pages don’t just grab a username and password–they also ask for answers to secret questions and other “backup” data that attackers can use to bypass multi-factor authentication and account recovery protections.

Instead of sending stolen data to a traditional command-and-control server, the kit forwards every submission to a Telegram bot. That gives the attackers a live feed of fresh logins they can use right away. It also sidesteps many domain-based blocking strategies and makes swapping infrastructure very easy.​

Phishing groups increasingly use services like Cloudflare Pages (`*.pages.dev`) to host their fake portals, sometimes copying a real login screen almost pixel for pixel. In this case, the actors spun up subdomains impersonating financial and healthcare providers. The first one we found was impersonating Heartland bank Arvest.

On closer look, the phishing site shows visitors two “failed login” screens, prompts for security questions, and then sends all credentials and answers to a Telegram bot.

Comparing their infrastructure with other sites, we found one impersonating a much more widely known brand: United Healthcare.

In this case, the phishers abused a compromised website as a redirector. Attackers took over a legitimate-looking domain like `biancalentinidesigns[.]com` and saddle it with [long, obscure paths](https://api.urlscan.io/ip/27.54.85.177) for phishing or redirection. Emails link to the real domain first, which then forwards the victim to the active Cloudflare pages phishing site. Messages containing a familiar or benign-looking domain are more likely to slip past spam filters than links that go straight to an obviously new cloud-hosted subdomain.​

Cloud-based hosting also makes takedowns harder. If one `*.pages.dev` hostname gets reported and removed, attackers can quickly deploy the same kit under another random subdomain and resume operations.​

The phishing kit at the heart of this campaign follows a multi-step pattern designed to look like a normal sign-in flow while extracting as much sensitive data as possible.​

Instead of using a regular form submission to a visible backend, JavaScript harvests the fields and bundles them into a message sent straight to the Telegram API.. That message can include the victim’s IP address, user agent, and all captured fields, giving criminals a tidy snapshot they can use to bypass defenses or sign in from a similar environment.​

The exfiltration mechanism is one of the most worrying parts. Rather than pushing credentials to a single hosted panel, the kit posts them into one or more Telegram chats using bot tokens and chat IDs hardcoded in the JavaScript. As soon as a victim submits a form, the operator receives a message in their Telegram client with the details, ready for immediate use or resal...
