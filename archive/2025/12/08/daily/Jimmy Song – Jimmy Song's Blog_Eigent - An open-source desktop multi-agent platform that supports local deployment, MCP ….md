## Detailed Introduction

Eigent is a desktop multi-agent workforce platform built on the CAMEL-AI multi-agent framework, designed to run locally or in the cloud. It offers visual workflow orchestration, a rich set of built-in tools (browser, code execution, document processing, etc.), and support for custom models and enterprise features like SSO, making it suitable for teams that require privacy and deep customization.

## Main Features

* Multi-agent collaboration: splits complex tasks into agents that run in parallel to improve efficiency and robustness.
* Rich tool integrations: built-in browser, document, and terminal tools, with support for installing custom tools via MCP integrations.
* Local and cloud deployment: supports zero-config cloud experiences as well as self-hosted local deployment for data privacy.
* Enterprise features: SSO, access control, and commercial licensing options.

## Use Cases

Eigent fits scenarios that need automation of multi-step workflows, such as research assistance, product research, automated report generation, data cleaning, and scripted office workflows. Its local deployment capability also suits enterprises with privacy and compliance needs.

## Technical Features

Eigent uses modern web and backend technologies (React, Electron, FastAPI) to implement desktop client and server components, supports MCP tool integrations and custom model hookups. The project is open source and actively maintained by the community, released under an Apache-2.0 based open-source license variant to facilitate extension and customization.
