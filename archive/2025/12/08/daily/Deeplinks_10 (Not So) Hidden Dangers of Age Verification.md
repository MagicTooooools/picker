It’s nearly the end of 2025, and [half of the US](https://www.404media.co/missouri-age-verification-law-porn-id-check-vpns/) and [the UK](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/americans-be-warned-lessons-reddits-chaotic-uk-age-verification-rollout) now require you to upload your ID or scan your face to watch “sexual content.” A [handful of states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_in_the_United_States#Summary) and [Australia](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/australia-enforce-social-media-age-limit-16-week-128064519) now have various requirements to verify your age before you can create a social media account.

Age-verification laws may sound straightforward to some: protect young people online by making everyone prove their age. But in reality, these mandates force users into one of two flawed systems—[mandatory ID checks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/effs-2024-battle-against-online-age-verification-defending-youth-privacy-and-free) or [biometric scans](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/face-scans-estimate-our-age-creepy-af-and-harmful)—and *both* are deeply discriminatory. These proposals burden everyone’s right to speak and access information online, and structurally excludes the very people who rely on the internet most. In short, although these laws are often passed with the intention to protect children from harm, the reality is that these laws harm both adults and children.

Here’s who gets hurt, and how:

### 1.  Adults Without IDs Get Locked Out

Document-based verification assumes everyone has the right ID, in the right name, at the right address. About 15 million adult U.S. citizens [don’t...
