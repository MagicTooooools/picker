# Scammers harvesting Facebook photos to stage fake kidnappings, warns FBI

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 8, 2025

The FBI has [warned](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA251205) about a new type of scam where your Facebook pictures are harvested to act as “proof-of-life” pictures in a virtual kidnapping.

The scammers pretend they have kidnapped somebody and contact friends and next of kin to demand a ransom for their release. While the alleged victim is really just going about their normal day, criminals show the family real Facebook photos to “prove” that person is still alive but in their custody.

This attack resembles [Facebook cloning](https://www.hoax-slayer.com/p/facebook-cloning-explained-how-scammers) but with a darker twist. Instead of just impersonating you to scam your friends, attackers weaponize your pictures to stage fake proof‑of‑life evidence.

Both scams feed on oversharing. Public posts give criminals more than enough information to impersonate you, copy your life, and convince your loved ones something is wrong.

This alert focuses on criminals scraping photos from social media (usually Facebook, but also LinkedIn, X, or any public profile) then manipulating those images with AI or simple editing to use during extortion attempts. If you know what to look for, you might spot inconsistencies like missing tattoos, unusual lighting, or proportions that don’t quite match.

Scammers rely on panic. They push tight deadlines, threaten violence, and try to force split-second decisions. That emotional pressure is part of their playbook.

In recent years, the FBI has also warned about synthetic media and deepfakes, like explicit images generated from benign photos and then used for sextortion, which is a closely related pattern of abuse of user‑posted pictures. Together, these warnings point to a trend: ordinary profile photos, holiday snaps, and professional headshots are increasingly weaponized for extortion rather than classic account hacking.

## What you can do

To make it harder for criminals to use these tactics, be mindful of what information you share on social media. Share pictures of yourself, [or your children](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/inside-malwarebytes/2025/11/sharenting-are-you-leaving-your-kids-digital-footprints-for-scammers-to-find), only with actual friends and not for the whole world to find. And when you’re travelling, post the beautiful pictures you have taken when you’re back, not while you’re away from home.

[Facebook’s built-in privacy tool](https://www.facebook.com/help/443357099140264) lets you quickly adjust:

* Who can see your posts.
* Who can see your profile information.
* App and website permissions.

If you’re on the receiving end of a virtual kidnapping attempt:

* Establish a code word only you and your loved ones know that you can use to prove it’s really you.
* Always attempt to contact the alleged victim before considering paying any ransom demand.
* Keep records of every communication with the scammers. They can be helpful in a police investigation.
* Report the incident to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at [www.ic3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/).
