# Bun

An integrated high-performance JavaScript platform combining runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner to speed up development and builds.

Author:
Oven

Since:
2021-04-14

[Visit Website](https://bun.sh) [GitHub](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)

## Detailed Introduction

Bun is a high-performance JavaScript platform developed by Oven that combines a runtime, bundler, package manager, and test runner into a single integrated experience. Distributed as a single binary, Bun focuses on fast startup, speedy dependency installation, and build performance, making it suitable for local development, CI pipelines, and edge function environments. See the official site at
[bun.sh](https://bun.sh)and the project repository on
[GitHub](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).

## Main Features

* Integrated platform: runtime, bundling, package management, and testing in one toolchain.
* High performance: optimized I/O and startup paths to reduce script execution and build times.
* Compatibility: supports common Node.js APIs and modern ECMAScript features.
* Single-binary distribution: easy installation and deployment.

## Use Cases

Bun is suitable for building static sites, running development scripts, accelerating frontend build pipelines, running lightweight services on the edge or serverless platforms, and improving install/test times in CI. It is also a good fit for microservices and edge functions that require fast startup and high concurrency I/O.

## Technical Features

Implemented in modern systems languages like Zig for core components, Bun minimizes runtime overhead and improves concurrency. It includes a high-performance JavaScript engine and native networking I/O, provides native package installation and bundling workflows, and supports fast resolution of common npm packages. The project is open-source and welcomes community contributions.
