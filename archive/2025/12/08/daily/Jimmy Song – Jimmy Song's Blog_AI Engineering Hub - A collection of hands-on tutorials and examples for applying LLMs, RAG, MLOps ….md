# AI Engineering Hub

A collection of hands-on tutorials and examples for applying LLMs, RAG, MLOps and agentic applications in production.

## Detailed Introduction

AI Engineering Hub is an open-source curated collection maintained by the author, focused on translating large model techniques into production-ready engineering practices. It aggregates in-depth tutorials, runnable examples, and templates covering large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), MLOps, deployment and agentic applications, helping engineers convert conceptual methods into reproducible workflows.

## Main Features

* Hands-on tutorials: step-by-step guides and example projects for LLMs, RAG and multimodal setups.
* Engineering-first: emphasis on reproducible code, deployment, and evaluation pipelines for production use.
* Open and extendable: MIT-licensed and community-contributable for new examples and tooling.
* Broad coverage: includes data pipelines, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and monitoring practices.

## Use Cases

This hub suits developers learning production AI engineering, product teams building prototypes, and SRE/engineering teams establishing model deployment workflows. The examples and best practices accelerate iteration from experiment to production.

## Technical Features

The repository primarily uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks, providing modular examples, experiment artifacts, and deployment notes. It emphasizes integration with standard toolchains (containerization, CI/CD, observability) and includes runnable demos for fast validation of engineering hypotheses.
