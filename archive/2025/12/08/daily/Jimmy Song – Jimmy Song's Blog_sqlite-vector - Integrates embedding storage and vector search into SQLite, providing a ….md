# sqlite-vector

Integrates embedding storage and vector search into SQLite, providing a cross-platform lightweight vector database extension.

## Detailed Introduction

sqlite-vector is an open-source SQLite extension from SQLiteAI that brings vector search capabilities to embedded databases. The extension enables storing, indexing, and querying embedding vectors directly within local SQLite instances, supporting cross-platform deployment and lightweight scenarios so developers can build near-real-time retrieval-augmented systems without an external vector database service.

## Main Features

* Embedded vector index: store and query vectors directly in SQLite to reduce external dependencies and operations overhead.
* Efficient implementation: optimized for performance and memory footprint, suitable for local and mobile deployments.
* Cross-platform: as a SQLite extension, it supports multiple operating systems and runtime environments.
* Easy integration: works with common embedding generation and retrieval workflows to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in applications.

## Use Cases

Ideal for local or edge vector search scenarios such as offline search, privacy-sensitive retrieval, lightweight recommendations, and on-device semantic search. Engineering teams can add vector retrieval capabilities into existing SQLite databases without deploying external services, enabling low-latency similarity queries and RAG pipelines.

## Technical Features

The project is implemented primarily in C as a SQLite extension, leveraging efficient data structures and indexing strategies for similarity search. It emphasizes compatibility with SQLite native features to smoothly introduce vector capabilities into existing database architectures.
