# The Bubble Is Labor

We've forgotten that companies have never wanted to hire anyone in the first place

I can't remember when I realized this, but I want to say it was less than five or ten years ago. Scared the crap out of me then, and still does whenever I think about it.

"Themselves" meaning the founder(s)/owner(s).

**Companies only hire people because they can't do all the work themselves.**

If every founder had 10,000 hands and brains they could assign to different tasks, there would be a minuscule fraction of the jobs we have today.

If you think about this for more than a few minutes, it starts to really mess with you, and you'll likely head down the same path I did.

1. *(Nodding)* Oh, I guess that's true...I guess somebody who can do all the work themselves wouldn't need to hire anybody...
2. *(Logical)* And I guess they shouldn't be required to hire people that they don't need. That would be weird...
3. *(Quizzical)* But aren't we telling millions of kids in high school and college that there are—and always will be—jobs waiting for them if they work hard?
4. *(Nervous)* So...who's actually guaranteeing that those jobs are there? Whose job is it to create jobs?
5. *(Panic)* Oh shit. **Nobody**. It's *nobody's* job to create jobs.

For the vast majority of companies, [the ideal number of employees is zero](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/real-problem-job-market).

In other words, the only reason the current labor market (and our economy that's based on it) exist at all is because there's a group of founders/owners who need *lots* of help producing their goods and services.

They are not required by *anyone* to hire me or you to help them if they don't need that help. And the *exact* moment they can do the work themselves, they will, and not a second after.

# So where does AI sit in all of this? [​](#so-where-does-ai-sit-in-all-of-this)

Everyone's currently obsessed with how much money is being spent/wasted on AI, as if it's the dumbest use of money ever.

But when you look at it in this "returning to natural state of doing their own work" framing, it's not stupid at all.

Don't think of it as them hiring AI instead of hiring people. Think of it as them just doing the work themselves.

I sent my [army of researchers](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Substrate/blob/main/Data/Knowledge-Worker-Global-Salaries/knowledge-worker-compensation-data.md#research-metadata) to go figure out how much money is spent on knowledge work compensation in a year. The numbers are ridiculous. It's around [$10 trillion in the US and $70 trillion worldwide](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Substrate/blob/main/Data/Knowledge-Worker-Global-Salaries/knowledge-worker-compensation-data.md#total-market-value).

That's *annually*.

As owners/founders, investing a few tens of trillions to be able to "just do it myself" suddenly looks pretty smart.

So basically, this entire pitch to young people that there will always be jobs after you graduate—which I somehow lived my entire life thinking was a fucking *Human Law of Physics*—is actually just a temporary side effect of early civilizations with bad technology.

* Big-L *Labor*...a side effect.
* Our whole ass economy that's based on us spending money earned by *doing* that labor...a side effect.

What the actual hell. I've known this for years now, but it stuns me every time I think about it.

Hopefully you can use this frame to better understand both AI and the forces that are pushing it. And as a prod to start thinking about what comes after.

#### Notes

1. I am aware that there are some corporations, companies, and definitely startups that like working with people and growing people. But that's not really the question. The question is, are there enough companies that are like that? Who would hire people that they don't actually need? And are there enough of those to sustain a $70 trillion workforce that's powering our economy? I think the answer is no.
2. [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (OEWS)](https://www.bls.gov/oes/): Official U.S. government wage data covering millions of establishments. Found ~100M knowledge workers (38-42% of workforce), with total U.S. labor compensation at $13.5T annually. Tech sector median: $104,556; Healthcare practitioners: $83,090.
3. [OECD Average Wages](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/average-wages.htm): International wage comparisons across developed economies. Switzerland leads at $115K average, Denmark $84K, Germany $64K. Provides the basis for global knowledge worker estimates.

5. [Dice Tech Salary Report 2025](https://www.dice.com/recruiting/ebooks/tech-salary-report/): U.S. technology sector salaries. Found tech average of $112,521 with only +1.2% YoY growth in 2024, but 23% annual tech sector wage inflation overall. Senior engineers: $130K-$164K.
6. [Robert Half 2026 Salary Guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide): Professional staffing firm data. Key finding: AI/ML roles command 30-50% premium over non-AI positions. AI Architects averaging $204,463; ML Engineers at $197,170.
7. [Upwork Research Institute](https://www.upwork.com/research): Freelance knowledge worker data from 3,000 survey respondents. Found 28% of U.S. knowledge workers (~20M) are freelancers, generating $1.5 trillion annually.
