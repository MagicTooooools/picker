It's getting harder to tell where normal tech ends and malicious intent begins. Attackers are no longer just breaking in — they're blending in, hijacking everyday tools, trusted apps, and even AI assistants. What used to feel like clear-cut "hacker stories" now looks more like a mirror of the systems we all use.

This week's findings show a pattern: precision, patience, and persuasion. The newest campaigns don't shout for attention — they whisper through familiar interfaces, fake updates, and polished code. The danger isn't just in what's being exploited, but in how ordinary it all looks.

ThreatsDay pulls these threads together — from corporate networks to consumer tech — revealing how quiet manipulation and automation are reshaping the threat landscape. It's a reminder that the future of cybersecurity won't hinge on bigger walls, but on sharper awareness.

1. Open-source tool exploited

   [Abuse of Nezha for Post-Exploitation](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/chinese-hackers-weaponize-open-source.html)

   Bad actors are leveraging an open-source monitoring tool named [Nezha](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/chinese-hackers-weaponize-open-source.html) to gain remote access to compromised hosts. Its ability to allow administrators to view system health, execute commands, transfer files, and open interactive terminal sessions also makes it an attractive choice for threat actors. In one incident [investigated](https://www.ontinue.com/resource/nezha-the-monitoring-tool-thats-also-a-perfect-rat/) by Ontinue, the tool was deployed as a post-exploitation remote access tool by means of a bash script, while pointing to a remote dashboard hosted on Alibaba Cloud infrastructure located in Japan. "The weaponization of Nezha reflects an emerging modern attack strategy where threat actors systematically abuse legitimate software to achieve persistence and lateral movement while evading signature-based defenses," said Mayuresh Dani, security research manager at Qualys. The abuse of Nezha is part of broader efforts where attackers leverage legitimate tools to evade signature detection, blend with normal activity, and reduce development effort.
2. Facial scans for SIMs

   [South Korea to Require Face Scans to Buy a SIM](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251219001900320)

   South Korea will begin requiring people to submit to facial recognition when signing up for a new mobile phone number in a bid to tackle scams and identity theft, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT. "By comparing the photo on an identification card with the holder's actual face on a real-time basis, we can fully prevent the activation of phones registered under a false name using stolen or fabricated IDs," the ministry [said](https://www.msit.go.kr/bbs/view.do?sCode=user&mId=307&mPid=208&pageIndex=&bbsSeqNo=94&nttSeqNo=3186671&searchOpt=ALL&searchTxt=). The new policy, which applies to SK Telecom, Korea Telecom, and LG Uplus, and other mobile virtual network operators, [takes effect](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251219001900320) on March 23 after a pilot following a [trial that began this week](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/law-crime/20251223/korea-begins-trial-of-mandatory-face-recognition-for-new-mobile-numbers). The science ministry has [emphasized](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251224006300320) that no data will be stored as part of the new policy. "We are well aware that the public is concerned due to a series of hacking incidents at local mobile carriers," the ministry said. "Contrary to concerns raised by some, no personal information is stored or saved, and it is immediately erased once identification is verified."
3. Android NFC threat spike

   [NFC-Abusing Android Malware Surges in H2 2025](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/raton-android-malware-detected-with-nfc.html)

   Data from ESET has revealed that detections of NFC-abusing Android malware grew by 87% between H1 and H2 2025. This increase has been coupled with the growing sophistication of NFC-based malware, such as the harvesting of victims' contacts, disabling of biometric verification, and [bringing together](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/raton-android-malware-detected-with-nfc.html) NFC attacks with remote access trojan (RAT) features and Automated Transfer System (ATS) capabilities. In these campaigns, malicious apps distributing malware such as [PhantomCard](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/new-android-malware-wave-hits-banking.html) prompt victims to hold their payment card near the phone and enter their PIN for authentication. In the process, the captured information is relayed to the attackers. "Recent innovations in the NFC sphere demonstrate that threat actors no longer rely solely on relay attacks: they are blending NFC exploitation with advanced capabilities such as remote access and automated transfers," ESET [said](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-threat-report-h2-2025/). "The efficiency of the scams is further fueled by advanced social engineering and technologies that can bypass biometric verification."
4. Fake PoCs spread malware

   [Fake PoCs Lead to WebRAT](https://securelist.com/webrat-distributed-via-github/118555/)

   Threat actors are now targeting inexperienced professionals and students in the information security field with fake proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for security flaws such as CVE-2025-59295, CVE-2025-10294, and CVE-2025-59230 to trick them into installing [WebRAT](https://rt-solar.ru/events...
