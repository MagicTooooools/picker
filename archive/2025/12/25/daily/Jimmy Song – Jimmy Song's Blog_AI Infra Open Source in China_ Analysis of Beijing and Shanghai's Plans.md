## Perspective on Beijing and Shanghai’s Open Source Plans

Using the simultaneous release of open source ecosystem plans by Beijing and Shanghai as a lens, and drawing on China’s past foundation practices and international open source governance experience, this article explores the real opportunities, structural constraints, and potential risks as AI Infrastructure (AI Infra, Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure) enters a new phase of institutionalized open source.

## Why Compare Beijing and Shanghai Together

It is rare for me to write an article solely because of a local policy document. However, during Christmas, both Beijing and Shanghai’s Bureaus of Economy and Information Technology released their respective open source ecosystem construction plans:

* [Building an Open Source Innovation Highland! Beijing Releases Open Source Ecosystem Construction Implementation Plan](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/9YEL1HORWatsol3nRT596w)
* [Shanghai’s Implementation Plan for Strengthening the Open Source System | Infographic](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QZl66fUllKiePwQ7euhiGQ)

This time, the fact that both cities released their plans on the same day sends a signal worth serious attention: China is attempting to advance open source in a more systematic and institutionalized way, especially regarding open source capabilities related to AI Infra.

If you only look at Beijing’s plan, it is easy to interpret it as a local industrial policy upgrade. But when you consider both Beijing and Shanghai’s plans together, it looks more like a clearly defined “dual-center structure.”

The question is no longer whether to develop open source, but:

> In the AI era, what institutional forms, engineering paths, and governance models will open source take?

## Open Source as “Industrial Infrastructure Engineering”

Both Beijing and Shanghai’s plans reflect a highly consistent judgment:

> Open source is no longer seen as a spontaneous community activity, but as an industrial infrastructure capability that requires systematic construction.

This is especially evident in the field of AI Infra.

Issues such as computing power scheduling, model evaluation, toolchains, data elements, license compliance, and supply chain security—previously hidden in “engineering details”—are now systematically incorporated into policy language for the first time. This at least shows that decision-makers have realized:

* AI competition is not only about model parameter scale
* It is even more about toolchains, infrastructure, evaluation systems, and engineering capabilities
* These capabilities are naturally more suitable for building public foundations through open source

In this respect, Beijing and Shanghai are highly aligned.

## Two Open Source Paths: Infra vs. Platform

When we zoom in, the differences between the two plans become clear.

**Beijing: “Foundation-Oriented” Open Source Path for AI Infra**

Beijing’s plan focuses on:

* Heterogeneous computing power scheduling
* Model evaluation toolchains
* Data elements and data governance
* RISC-V software-hardware collaboration
* SBOM, license compatibility, open source compliance
* Supply chain security and industrial resilience

This is a typical perspective of “treating AI as an infrastructure problem.”

It is less concerned with the number of projects or community size, and more with:

* Whether reusable engineering capabilities can be formed
* Whether these can be trusted by industry and government over the long term
* Whether they can stand up to scrutiny in terms of security, compliance, and governance

To some extent, Beijing is answering the question:

> How can open source become a “governable, auditable, and scalable public capability”?

**Shanghai: “Scale and Internationalization” Path for AI Platform**

In contrast, Shanghai’s plan has a different focus:

* Building an international open source community for artificial intelligence
* Covering the entire platform chain from development, training, testing, hosting, to operation
* Overseas sites, multilingual support, international activities
* Resource linkage through computing vouchers and model vouchers
