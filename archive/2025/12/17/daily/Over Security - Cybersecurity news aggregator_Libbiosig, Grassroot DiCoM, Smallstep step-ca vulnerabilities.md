Cisco Talos’ Vulnerability Discovery & Research team recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Biosig Project Libbiosig, Grassroot DiCoM, and Smallstep step-ca.

The vulnerabilities mentioned in this blog post have been patched by their respective vendors, all in adherence to [Cisco’s third-party vulnerability disclosure policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html), except for Grassroot, as the DiCoM vulnerabilities are zero-days.

For Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from [Snort.org](https://snort.org/), and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on [Talos Intelligence’s website](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports).

## **Libbiosig vulnerability**

*Discovered by Mark Bereza of Cisco Talos.*

BioSig is an open source software library for biomedical signal processing. The BioSig Project seeks to encourage research in biomedical signal processing by providing open source software tools.

[TALOS-2025-2296](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2296) (CVE-2025-66043-CVE-2025-66048) includes several stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the MFER parsing functionality of the Biosig Project libbiosig 3.9.1. An attacker can supply a specially crafted MFER file to trigger these vulnerabilities, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.

## **Grassroot DiCoM vulnerabilities**

*Discovered by Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos.*

Grassroots DiCoM is a C++ library for DICOM medical files, accessible from Python, C#, Java, and PHP. It supports RAW, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG-LS, RLE and deflated transfer syntax. Talos found three out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in DiCoM. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger these vulnerabilities.

* [TALOS-2025-2214](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2214) (CVE-2025-48429) can lead to leaking heap data.

## **Smallstep step-ca vulnerabilities**

*Discovered by Stephen Kubik of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).*

Smallstep step-ca is a TLS-secured online Certificate Authority (CA) for X.509 and SSH certificate management. [TALOS-2025-2242](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2025-2242) (CVE-2025-44005) is an authentication bypass vulnerability in step-ca.
