# Roblox in talks with Russia to restore access after platform ban sparks backlash

Russian authorities said on Wednesday that game platform Roblox has indicated it is willing to bring its operations into line with Russian law as it seeks to overturn a nationwide ban.

According to Russia’s media regulator [Roskomnadzor](https://rkn.gov.ru/press/news/news74971.htm), the U.S.-based company acknowledged shortcomings in moderating in-game content and securing user chats, and reached out to the agency to discuss potential changes. Russia [blocked](https://therecord.media/russia-bans-roblox-drawing-criticism-from-kids) Roblox earlier this month, accusing it of hosting “extremist materials” and “LGBT propaganda,” and saying its moderation system allowed content that could “negatively affect the spiritual and moral development of children.”

Roskomnadzor said Roblox expressed “readiness” to take steps to remove what the agency describes as “destructive and dangerous information,” prevent criminal activity and curb unlawful communications between users. The regulator added that Roblox had previously failed to respond to its requests.

“If this is not merely a statement but a genuine willingness by the platform to change its approach to ensuring children’s safety online, Roskomnadzor will cooperate with the platform, as it does with any other service that complies with Russian legislation,” the agency said.

The ban triggered a backlash among the platform’s estimated 18 million monthly users in Russia — mostly children and teenagers — who have launched social media campaigns and video petitions calling on officials to restore access. Over the weekend, small protests were [reported](https://www.indy100.com/gaming/russia-roblox-ban-vladimir-putin) in parts of Siberia, where demonstrators held signs reading “Hands off Roblox” and “Roblox is a victim of the digital Iron Curtain.”

Roblox [confirmed](https://www.reuters.com/business/roblox-gaming-platform-says-it-is-ready-make-changes-get-russian-ban-lifted-2025-12-17/) to Reuters that it is in contact with Roskomnadzor and is ready to temporarily limit communication features and revise its moderation practices to meet Russian legal requirements. The company declined to say when access to the platform might be restored.

Such compliance is relatively rare among major U.S. technology companies operating in Russia, many of which have been blocked or scaled back operations since the Kremlin tightened control over the internet following its invasion of Ukraine. Roblox, however, has previously taken a similar approach elsewhere.

Last year, after Turkey [blocked](https://therecord.media/roblox-game-platform-blocked-turkey-government) Roblox over concerns that content on the platform could facilitate the exploitation of children, the company said it would work with authorities to bring the service back online. “We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers’ commitment to children,” Roblox said at the time.

The crackdown on Roblox comes as Moscow expands restrictions on foreign technology platforms. In recent weeks, Russia has blocked or limited access to several Western online services, including [WhatsApp](https://therecord.media/russia-whatsapp-restrictions), Snapchat and Apple’s FaceTime.
