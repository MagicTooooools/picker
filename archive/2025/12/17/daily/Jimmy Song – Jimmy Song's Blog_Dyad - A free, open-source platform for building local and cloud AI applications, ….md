## Detailed Introduction

Dyad is an open-source platform for building local and cloud AI applications. Positioned as a free, locally runnable AI app builder, it helps developers and creators quickly assemble interactive generative apps and agent-like services, emphasizing a local-first experience for privacy-sensitive and low-latency scenarios.

## Main Features

* Local-first: support for local deployment and offline development, prioritizing privacy and low latency.
* LLM compatible: integrates with OpenAI / Anthropic and other large language model (LLM) APIs for flexible model access.
* Templates & examples: provides React + TypeScript frontend samples and reusable components to accelerate prototyping.
* Plugins & memory: supports plugin extensions and memory mechanisms for building extensible application capabilities.

## Use Cases

* Building chat apps, content-generation tools, and interactive product prototypes.
* Local or CI-based model integration and offline testing.
* Desktop/edge deployments that require privacy-preserving, low-latency inference.

## Technical Details

Dyad is built with TypeScript and React, using a modular architecture and open APIs that emphasize fast iteration and extensibility. Repository topics include ai-app-builder and llm; the project is community-driven and suited for teams and individuals aiming to productize model capabilities quickly.
