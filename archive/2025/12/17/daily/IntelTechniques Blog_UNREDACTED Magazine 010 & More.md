I am happy to report that our experiment with issue 009 was a bigger success than our previous attempt. Let's recap. Issue 008 was our first offering free of ads or sponsors. We asked people to donate if they wanted to see future content. We had over 50,000 downloads, but only a handful of donations. We failed. With 009, we charged a $10 fee with the desire of releasing it for free once this issue was ready. We saw a steady trickle of sales which almost covered our content creation and publishing costs, but ultimately, we failed again (but failed much, much less!).

Future sales of those issues and beyond will be required to keep this thing going, and keep the team paid for their efforts. With this issue, we are transitioning to a purely paid model. Issues 008, 009, 010, and beyond will have a fee, but the first seven issues will still be free on our site. We will not offer any type of subscription; readers can simply purchase the issues they find most interesting. You can buy the latest issue at:

<https://payhip.com/b/HCGZr>

We believe this new recipe will keep the information flowing. This allows us to spend more time generating and testing new and unbiased content. Thank you for your patience while we learn our path. I sincerely thank everyone who supported us by purchasing any issues. We estimate issue 011 will be available in Spring of 2026, with quarterly issues following. More details are available over at <https://unredactedmagazine.com/>.

We also released some archived books. Many people have asked to purchase our previous editions of Extreme Privacy and OSINT Techniques, and our digital guides from 2023 to 2024. We removed them in 2024 because the latest editions of our two main books incorporated most of that content into a more structured flow. We didn't want outdated or redundant information being sold on our site. However, we respect that some people prefer the previous delivery and dedicated topic format. Some are just archivists who want every nugget of our research. Therefore, we now offer the older material at a discounted price on our site at:

<https://payhip.com/IntelTechniquesBooks/collection/archived-books>

You can also browse our current titles, magazine issues, and bundled discounts. We may even dig deeper into the vault for some unreleased content.

We now present issue 010 of UNREDACTED Magazine, and hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it. **This issue is the largest we have ever released**.
