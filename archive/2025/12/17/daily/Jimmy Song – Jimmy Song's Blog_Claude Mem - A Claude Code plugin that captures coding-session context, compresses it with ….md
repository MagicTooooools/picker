# Claude Mem

## Detailed Introduction

Claude Mem is a plugin for Claude Code that automatically captures interactions and workflow information during coding sessions, compresses those contexts using AI via Claude’s agent-sdk, and injects relevant memories into future sessions. The project integrates memory storage and retrieval pipelines, supporting embedding-based search and long-term memory management to improve context continuity and developer productivity across sessions.

## Main Features

* Automatic capture: records important events and context snippets during coding sessions.
* AI compression: semantically compresses captured content using Claude’s agent-sdk to reduce storage cost.
* Memory injection: injects relevant memories into subsequent sessions to improve continuity.

## Use Cases

* Maintain conversational continuity during coding and debugging without re-explaining past steps.
* Integrate session memories into RAG pipelines to improve long-term project performance.
* Extend developer toolchains with memory plugins to enhance collaboration and knowledge retention.

## Technical Details

Implemented in TypeScript, the project integrates Claude’s agent-sdk and can pair with vector databases or SQLite backends for persistent memory. Repository topics include ai-memory, long-term-memory, and rag—targeting scenarios that need long-lived context management and memory retrieval.
