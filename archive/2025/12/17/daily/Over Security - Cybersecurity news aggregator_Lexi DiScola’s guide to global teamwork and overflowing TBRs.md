# Lexi DiScola’s guide to global teamwork and overflowing TBRs

Welcome back to Humans of Talos. This month, Amy chats with Senior Cyber Threat Analyst Lexi DiScola from the Strategic Analysis team. Lexi’s journey into cybersecurity is anything but traditional — she brings a background in political science and French to her work tracking global cyber threats and collaborating with colleagues across continents.

Tune in as Lexi opens up about finding her place in cybersecurity, the unique strengths that come from a non-technical path, and the joys (and challenges) of balancing complex intel analysis with a towering stack of books to be read (TBR) at home.

**Amy Ciminnisi: Can you introduce yourself? What do you do here at Talos? What team do you work on, and what does your day-to-day look like?**

Lexi DiScola: Sure. I’m on the strategic analysis team here at Talos. I joined about three years ago. What my team does is a whole bunch of things, really, but we focus on tracking and analyzing major trends in the cyber threat landscape. We maintain intelligence sharing relationships with a bunch of private sector and government partners. We conduct regular threat hunting activity in our telemetry and support the Talos Incident Response team. My favorite part is producing written analytical products — logs, intelligence bulletins, threat assessment reports, and our annual Year in Review report, which we just started working on. We’ve kicked into high gear, prepping for the year in review, taking all the data we’ve accumulated and seeing what we can pull out of it. It sounds like a headache to some people, but for us, it’s fun, so we’re looking forward to it.

**AC: What made you want to join Talos, and when did you join?**

LD: I joined about three years ago this fall. I worked in cyber threat intelligence in a government position before. Because of that experience, I was always aware of Talos’s reputation in this space. When I was looking to shift to the private sector from the government, I knew I’d be working with some of the best of the best here. I knew I wouldn’t be stagnant if I came here. That was my focus in a new position — I always want to be learning and working toward something.

**AC: What are your favorite resources for staying up to date with current trends in cybersecurity?**

LD: There are multiple sources I look at. OSINT, or open-source intelligence, is a huge tool, especially when focusing on specific countries or nation-state actors. Looking at their local reporting and translating it is super helpful, and looking at competitors’ or cybersecurity researchers’ reporting is also useful. But I really rely on the people I work with. Talos has so many talented people who are always willing to help. At first, I was hesitant to ask questions, but as I got to know people better, I stopped feeling embarrassed. It’s a two-way street. You might feel awkward asking for help, but down the road, they may ask you for help with something you’re an expert in. Asking people and not being afraid or embarrassed has served me well.
