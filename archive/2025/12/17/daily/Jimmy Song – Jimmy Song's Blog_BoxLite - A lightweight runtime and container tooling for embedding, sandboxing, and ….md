## Detailed Introduction

BoxLite is a lightweight toolkit for running and shipping AI agents. It provides an embeddable runtime and containerized sandbox to isolate, debug, and deploy agent workloads in controlled environments. Implemented in Rust, the project focuses on minimal runtime dependencies, performance, and strong security boundaries, making it suitable for local development, CI testing, and edge or cloud deployments.

## Main Features

* Sandboxed execution: container-based and process isolation to reduce runtime risk.
* Embeddable runtime: integrate agent capabilities into existing applications for lightweight deployments.
* Image & deployment: OCI image compatibility and container workflow support for CI/CD integration.
* Minimal dependencies & performance: Rust implementation minimizes runtime overhead and improves execution efficiency and safety.

## Use Cases

* Sandbox testing of agent behaviors locally and in CI to reproduce and debug before production.
* Running agent inference or automation tasks as small images in constrained or edge environments.
* Embedding agent features as components for higher-level applications to accelerate prototyping and delivery.

## Technical Details

BoxLite is developed in Rust and released under the Apache-2.0 license. It emphasizes containerized sandboxing, image-based delivery, and a minimal runtime footprint. Repository topics include ai-agents, sandbox, containers, and serverless—targeting scenarios that require isolation, security boundaries, and lightweight deployment.
