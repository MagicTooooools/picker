# Inside a purchase order PDF phishing campaign

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 17, 2025

![phish hook in laptop](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/phished_laptop.png?w=1200)

*A PDF named “`NEW Purchase Order # 52177236.pdf`” turned out to be a phishing lure. So we analyzed the phishing script behind it.*

A customer contacted me when Malwarebytes blocked the link inside a “purchase order” email they had received.

![Malwarebytes blocks a ionoscloud.com subdomain](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ionoscloudblock.png)

Malwarebytes blocked this ionoscloud.com subdomain

When I examined the attachment, it soon became clear why we blocked it.

The visible content of the PDF showed a button prompting the recipient to view the purchase order. Hovering over the button revealed a long URL that included a reference to a PDF viewer. While this might fool some people at first glance, a closer look raised red flags:

![the content of the pdf file whiel hovering over the button](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/inside_pdf.png?w=1024)

Hovering over the button to see where it goes

Since I’m rarely able to control my curiosity, I temporarily added an exclusion to Malwarebytes’ web protection so I could see where the link would take me. The destination was a website displaying a login form with the target’s email address already filled in (the address shown here was fabricated by me):

![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/login_form.png?w=1024)

The objective was clear: phishing. But the site’s source code didn’t reveal much.

The most likely objective was to harvest business email addresses and their passwords. Attackers commonly test these credentials against enterprise services such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Workspace, VPNs, file-sharing platforms, and payroll systems. The deliberately vague prompt for a “business email” increases the likelihood that users will provide corporate credentials rather than personal ones.

There was also a small personalization touch. The “Estimado” greeting sets a professional tone and is common in business correspondence across Spanish-speaking regions.

For a full analysis read on, but the real clue is that the harvested credentials accompanied additional information about the victim’s browser, operating system, language, cookies, screen size, and location. This data was sent directly to the scammer’s account on Telegram, where it’s likely to be used to compromise the business network or sold on to other cybercriminals.

A quick search on VirusTotal showed that there were several PDF files linking to the exact same `ionoscloud.com` subdomain.

## Analysis

As I pointed out earlier, the source code of the initial phishing page did not reveal a lot. These are probably auto-generated templates that can be planted on any website, allowing attackers a fast rotation.

![source code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/initial_site_code.png)

`ionoscloud.com` belongs to IONOS Cloud, the cloud infrastructure division of IONOS, a major European hosting company. It offers services similar to Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure, including hosting for websites and files. Scammers specifically choose reputable cloud platforms like IONOS Cloud because of the “halo effect” of being hosted at a well-known domain, which means security companies can’t just block the whole domain.

The criminals also get the flexibility to quickly spin up, modify, or tear down phishing sites and...
