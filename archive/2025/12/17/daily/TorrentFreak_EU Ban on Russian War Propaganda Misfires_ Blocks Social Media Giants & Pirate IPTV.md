# EU Ban on Russian War Propaganda Misfires: Blocks Social Media Giants & Pirate IPTV

To help its members comply with the EU sanctions against Russian war propaganda, the Dutch ISP trade association compiled a consolidated blocklist. This list is based on input from regulators in other countries and features over 700 blocking targets. It includes several unexpected blocklist entries, such as the social media networks Weibo and ShareChat, pirate IPTV services, and other seemingly unrelated domain names.

These measures included bans on state-owned news outlets, [such as Russia Today and Sputnik](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/02/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-state-owned-outlets-rtrussia-today-and-sputnik-s-broadcasting-in-the-eu/), and also applied to the websites of these organizations.

To comply with these mandatory blocking requirements, ISPs in EU countries have indeed restricted access to the associated domain names. However, since there is no official EU-issued blocklist, it is not always clear what should be blocked exactly. With potential criminal prosecutions for non-compliance, that’s a problem.

## ISP Trade Organization Compiles ‘Unofficial’ Blocklist

The Dutch ISP trade association, [NLconnect](https://www.nlconnect.org/), has previously asked the Dutch authorities for guidance in this matter, but that failed to result in a concrete blocklist. In response, NLconnect therefore scraped the blocklists of regulators in Germany, Austria, Estonia, Finland, and Lithuania, to create a consolidated “reference list” for its members.

This week, [Tweakers](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/242636/nlconnect-deelt-lijst-te-blokkeren-russische-sites-bij-gebrek-aan-richtlijn.html) reported that the resulting blocklist was now being [shared in public](https://www.nlconnect.org/over-ons/nlconnect-reference-list-of-sanctioned-media-domains). While NLconnect doesn’t support site blocking as a technical intervention, it believes that the list helps its members to comply with the law.

“The consolidated list contains 796 domains. NLconnect advises its members to use this list to ensure compliance with the EU sanctions. We have also shared the list with Dutch regulator ACM and the Public Prosecutor. We are publishing this list to be fully transparent about the advice we have provided to our members,” NLconnect writes.

*NLconnect’s Excel*

Importantly, NLconnect did not vet any of the included domains and recognizes that it could include false positives or potential overblocking. And indeed, after a thorough review of the list, we can conclude that it is indeed quite broad.

## Blocking Weibo and ShareChat as Russian Propaganda

TorrentFreak confirmed that the NLconnect blocklist is already in use at Dutch Internet provider Ziggo. This means that its users no longer have access to hundreds of websites on the list. These indeed include news outlets Sputnikglobe.com and RT.com, but other blockades are more dubious.

For example, the blocklist also features domain names of various social media services. They include ShareChat, India’s largest homegrown social media platform, which is completely blocked due to sanctions. Our analysis confirms the domain originates from the blocklist of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTK).

*ShareChat*

![sharechat](https://torrentfreak.com/images/sharechat.png)

[ShareChat](https://sharechat.com/) has hundreds of millions of active users in India and labeling it as “Russian propaganda” is factually incorrect. The site may host specific propaganda accounts but the platform itself is an Indian technology success story, not a Kremlin asset.

If there is a problematic account on a social media site, it makes sense to address this with a targeted URL blockade instead of simply banning a domain that has millions of legitimate users.

This logic also applies to other domains, including the Chinese microblogging service Weibo.com, which has hundreds of millions of daily users, as well as the Indian equivalent Kooapp.com. These services are both completely blocked under (an interpretation of) EU sanctions.

## Online Streaming & Pirate IPTV Blockades

The blocklist also covers collections of online radio stations, such as the [Streema.com](https://streema.com/) portal, operated by the American company Streema Inc, as well as American media aggregator Viaway.com.

Neither service openly features Russian propaganda. They do list some banned Russian radio stations or feeds. But, instead of targeting these URLs specifically, these services have had their entire domains blocked instead.

Interestingly, NLconnect’s consolidated blocklist also includes various domain names that are linked to pirate IPTV services. These include IPTV-home.net, Ottclub.tv, Cbilling.eu, Iseetv.net, Limehd.tv, Snegiri.tv and many others.

While these domains are arguably infringing copyright and may eventually, after payment, offer access to Russian media, they are not intended as propaganda tools. On the contrary, the mentioned domains don’t specifically feature or highlight any of the banned outlets.

## The Lithuanian Connection

On closer inspection, it appears that most of these domains appear in the Russian propaganda blocklist compiled by the Lithuanian telecoms regulator LRTK. However, the [referenced text file](https://www.rtk.lt/uploads/documents/files/atviri-duomenys/neteisetos-veiklos-vykdytojai/domenu_adresu_sarasas.txt) also appears to include other unrelated domains, including many torrent sites.

*From the LRTK text file used by NLconnect*

This is a perplexing situation, and LRTK’s [dedicated sanctions page](https://www.rtk.lt/lt/atviri-duomenys/ribojimai-susije-su-tarptautiniu-sankciju-igyvendinimu) provides no additional insight either, as that also lists pirate sites and social media networks alongside Russian propaganda.

TorrentFreak asked the Lithuanian regulator LRTK to explain why a social network such as ShareChat.com is blocked under the Russian sanctions, but the organization did not immediately reply.

In the Netherlands, meanwhile, millions of Internet users no longer have access to websites and services that have little to do with Russian propaganda. And perhaps even more concerning, all of this has largely gone unnoticed by the public.

## Blocking Sites & Pointing Fingers

When presented with our findings, NLconnect Managing Director Mathieu Andriessen emphasized that the trade association is merely the messenger. The organization did not select or curate the domains, it simply aggregated them from foreign regulators because the Dutch government refused to provide a concrete list.

“NLconnect has not selected or identified domains itself and did not independently scour the Internet to link websites to sanctioned media ...
