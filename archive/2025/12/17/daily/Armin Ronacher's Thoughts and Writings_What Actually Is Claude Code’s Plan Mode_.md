# What Actually Is Claude Code’s Plan Mode?

written on December 17, 2025

I’ve mentioned this a few times now, but when I started using Claude it was
because [Peter](https://x.com/steipete/) got me hooked on it. From the very
beginning I became a religious user of what is colloquially called YOLO mode,
which basically gives the agent all the permissions so I can just watch it do
its stuff.

One consequence of YOLO mode though is that it didn’t work well together with
the plan mode that Claude Code had. In the beginning it didn’t inherit all the
tool permissions, so in plan mode it actually asked for approval all the time.
I found this annoying and as a result I never really used plan mode.

Since I haven’t been using it, I ended up with other approaches. I’ve talked
about this before, but it’s a version of iterating together with the agent on
creating a form of handoff in the form of a markdown file. My approach has
been getting the agent to ask me clarifying questions, taking these questions
into an editor, answering them, and then doing a bunch of iterations until I’m
decently happy with the end result.

That has been my approach and I thought that this was pretty popular these days.
For instance Mario’s [pi](https://shittycodingagent.ai/) which I also use, does
not have a plan mode and Amp is [removing
theirs](https://x.com/beyang/status/2001150592480313425).

However today I had two interesting conversations with people who really like
plan mode. As a non-user of plan mode, I wanted to understand how it works. So
I specifically looked at the Claude Code implementation to understand what it
does, how it prompts the agent, and how it steers the client. I wanted to use
the tool loop just to get a better understanding of what I’m missing out on.

This post is basically just what I found out about how it works, and maybe it’s
useful to someone who also does not use plan mode and wants to know what it
actually does.

## Plan Mode in Claude Code

First we need to agree on what a plan is in Claude Code. A plan in Claude Code
is effectively a markdown file that is written into Claude’s plans folder by
Claude in plan mode. The generated plan doesn’t have any extra structure beyond
text. So at least up to that point, there really is not much of a difference
between you asking it to write a markdown file or it creating its own internal
markdown file.

There are however some other major differences. One is that there are recurring
prompts to remind the agent that it’s in read-only mode. The tools for writing
files through the agent’s built-in tools are actually still there. It has a
little state machine going on to enter and exit plan mode that it can use.
Interestingly, it seems like the edit file tool is actually used to manipulate
the plan file. So the agent is seemingly editing its own plan file!

Because plan mode is also a tool (or at least the entering and exiting plan mode
is), the agent can enter it itself. This has the same effect as if you were to
press shift+tab. [1](#fn-1)

To encourage the agent to write the plan file, there is a custom prompt injected
when you enter it. There is no other enforcement from what I can tell. Other
agents might do this differently.

When exiting plan mode it will read the plan file that it wrote to disk and then
start working off that. So the path towards spec in the prompt always goes via
the file system.

## Can You Plan Mode Without Plan Mode?

This obviously raises the question: if the differences are not that significant
and it is just “the prompt” and some workflow around it, how much would you
have to write into the prompt yourself to get very similar behavior to what the
plan mode in Claude Code does?

From a user experience point of view, you basically get two things.

1. You get a markdown file, but you never get to see it because it’s hidden away
   in a folder. I would argue that putting it into a specific file has some
   benefits because you can edit it.
2. However there is something which you can’t really replicate and that is that
   plan mode at the end comes with a prompt to the user. That user interface
   you cannot bring up trivially because there is no way to bring it up without
   going through the exit plan mode flow, which requires the file to be in a
   specific location.

But if we ignore those parts and say that we just want similar behavior to what
plan mode does from prompting alone, how much prompt do we have to write? What
specifically is the delta of entering plan mode versus just writing stuff into
the context manually?

## The Prompt Differences

When entering plan mode a bunch of stuff is thrown into the context in addition
to the system prompt. I don’t want to give the entire prompt here verbatim
because it’s a little bit boring, but I want to break it down by roughly what it
sends.

The first thing it sends is general information that is now in plan mode which
is read-only:

> Plan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute
> yet — you MUST NOT make any edits (with the exception of the plan file
> mentioned below), run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or
> making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes
> any other instructions you have received.

Then there’s a little bit of stuff about how it should read and edit the plan
mode file, but this is mostly just to ensure that it doesn’t create new plan
files. Then it sets up workflow suggestions of how plans should be structured:

> ### Phase 1: Initial Understanding
>
> Goal: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the user’s request by reading

> 1. Focus on understanding the user’s request and the code associated with

> 2. (Instructions here about parallelism for tasks)

> In the agent prompt:

> ### Phase 3: Review

> Goal: Review the plan(s) from Phase 2 and ensure alignment with the user’s intentions.

> 1. Read the critical files identified by agents to deepen your understanding

I actually thought that there would be more to the prompt than this. In
particular, I was initially under the assumption that the tools actually turn
into read-only. But it is just prompt reinforcement that changes the behavior
of the tools and also which tools are available. It is in fact just a rather
short predefined prompt that enters plan mode. The tool to enter or exit plan
mode is always available, and the same is true for edit and read files. The
exiting of the plan mode tool has a description that instructs the agent to
understand when it’s done planning:

> Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to
> the plan file and are ready for user approval.
>
> ### How This Tool Works
>
> * You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the
>   plan mode system message
> * This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the
>   plan from the file you wrote
> * This tool simply signals that you’re done ...
