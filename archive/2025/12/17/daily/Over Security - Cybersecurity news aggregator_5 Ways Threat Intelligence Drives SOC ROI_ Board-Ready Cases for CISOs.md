5 Ways Threat Intelligence Drives ROI in SOCs: Board-Ready Cases for CISOs

When CISOs ask for budget, they are rarely competing against “no security.” They are competing against growth initiatives, product launches, and cost optimization.

Technical jargon and security metrics often fall flat here. To win the conversation, threat intelligence cannot be framed as more data for analysts. It must be positioned as a business enabler that reduces measurable risk, protects revenue, and accelerates decision-making.

Here are the board-ready cases that connect threat intelligence investments directly to business objectives.

## 1. Protecting Revenue and Avoiding Financial Loss

Boards understand one number very well: the cost of a breach. What they often underestimate is how much of that cost comes from late detection.

Reactive security means discovering threats after damage has already begun. By then, costs multiply across downtime, incident response, legal exposure, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.

Threat intelligence changes the equation.

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=email_and_blog&utm_campaign=threat-intel-board-cases&utm_term=171225&utm_content=linktotifeedslanding) deliver high-fidelity indicators sourced from interactive sandbox analyses of live malware samples and targeted attacks. This expands threat coverage, reduces the likelihood of successful breaches, and directly lowers potential financial impact — turning threat intelligence into a clear ROI driver.

[Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=threat-intel-board-cases&utm_term=171225&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) is another decision-enabling service from ANY.RUN. It is an on-demand searchable database that provides instant access to detailed threat reports, behavioral insights, direct links to sandbox sessions, and contextual connections between IOCs and active campaigns, enabling rapid enrichment during investigations. Instead of asking “What could happen?”, security leaders can answer “What is actively targeting organizations like ours right now?”

**Board-level takeaway:**

Early detection driven by real-world threat intelligence materially lowers breach impact and recovery costs.

**Message pattern:** “Investing in threat intelligence reduces our average incident response cost by 60-70% by enabling early detection and prevention. For every major incident we prevent, we save the organization between $1-4 million in direct costs, not including reputational damage and customer trust.”

Reduce business risks with actionable threat intel.

## 2. Ensuring Revenue-Critical Operations and Business Continuity

Board members understand downtime in dollars per minute. For e-commerce platforms, financial services, manufacturing operations, or SaaS providers, every minute of disruption translates directly to lost revenue, damaged customer relationships, and competitive disadvantage. Ransomware attacks alone now cost businesses [an average of 25 days](https://deepstrike.io/blog/ransomware-statistics-2025) of downtime — a strike that many organizations cannot absorb.

Threat intelligence supports resilience by helping organizations:

* Identify emerging attack campaigns early;

* Anticipate shifts in attacker tactics;

* Prepare controls before attacks reach critical systems.
