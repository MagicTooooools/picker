## Detailed Introduction

nanoGPT, published by Andrej Karpathy, is a minimal and efficient repository for training and fine-tuning medium-sized GPT models. Known for its clear implementation and small set of dependencies, nanoGPT helps researchers and engineers quickly learn Transformer training workflows, data preprocessing, and optimization techniques, and serves as a solid base for teaching and prototyping.

## Main Features

* Minimal implementation: compact codebase with clear logic for understanding Transformer and GPT training details.
* Training & fine-tuning: supports training from scratch and fine-tuning on smaller datasets for experiments.
* Reproducibility: example configurations and scripts facilitate reproducing training workflows and results.

## Use Cases

* Teaching and self-study to understand GPT architecture and training pipelines.
* Rapid prototyping of medium-sized model experiments.
* Researching training techniques, optimization methods, and data processing strategies in controlled environments.

## Technical Details

nanoGPT is implemented in Python with an emphasis on readability and experimentability, making it suitable as a practical repository from beginner to intermediate levels. The project is released under the MIT License and has an active community used widely in education, research, and small-scale product exploration.
