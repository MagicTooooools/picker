## Detailed Introduction

Refly is a vibe workflow platform for non-technical creators that lets users build automated content and processes via a visual canvas and low-code components. The platform integrates memory management, task orchestration, and model invocation, and can connect to external services—suitable for content creation, marketing automation, and knowledge workflows.

## Main Features

* Visual canvas and component library for drag-and-drop workflow construction.
* Vibe workflow paradigm that reduces complexity while remaining extensible.
* Integrations with large language models (LLMs) and data sources, supporting memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
* Plugin system and external service integrations for automated delivery.

## Use Cases

* Non-technical creators building content generation, editing, and publishing pipelines.
* Marketing automation and social media asset production and distribution.
* Integrating memory stores and retrieval into workflows for personalized recommendations and knowledge management.

## Technical Details

Refly is implemented in TypeScript with a modular component and plugin architecture, focusing on low-code UX and model integration capabilities. Repository topics include agent, ai-memory, workflow, and rag—targeting fast iteration and productization scenarios.
