# OpenSkills

A developer-focused universal skills loader that simplifies installing and managing skills for agents and scripts.

Author:

Since:
2025-10-26

## Detailed Introduction

OpenSkills is a developer-oriented universal skills loader for discovering, installing, and running “skills” in agent or script environments. Distributed as an npm package, it provides a CLI and lightweight interfaces to manage small tooling modules uniformly, reducing integration overhead when composing capabilities.

## Main Features

* Unified packaging and publishing workflow for skills via npm.
* A minimal CLI to list, install, uninstall and execute skills.
* Support for running skills as independent modules, making it easy to integrate locally or in CI pipelines.

## Use Cases

* Package standalone tools or scripts as skills for on-demand invocation by agents or automation flows.
* Rapidly experiment with new skills in local development or distribute and update skill collections in CI.
* Foster a small plugin ecosystem where the community contributes reusable utility modules.

## Technical Features

* Implemented in TypeScript with an emphasis on light weight and composability.
* Uses the npm ecosystem for distribution and versioning, compatible with existing build tools.
* Designed to be decoupled from specific agent runtimes or script hosts, focusing on discovery and execution contracts for skills.
