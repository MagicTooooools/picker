Another year has come and gone, and with it, thousands of data breaches that affect millions of people. The question these days is less, *Is my information in a data breach this year?* and more *How many data breaches had my information in them this year?*

Some data breaches are more noteworthy than others. Where one might affect a small number of people and include little useful information, like a name or email address, others might include data ranging from a potential medical diagnosis to specific location information. To catalog and talk about these breaches we created the [Breachies](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/breachies-2024-worst-weirdest-most-impactful-data-breaches-year), a series of tongue-in-cheek awards, to highlight the most egregious data breaches.

In most cases, if these companies practiced a [privacy first approach](https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms) and focused on data minimization, only collecting and storing what they absolutely need to provide the services they promise, many data breaches would be far less harmful to the victims. But instead, companies gobble up as much as they can, store it for as long as possible, and inevitably at some point someone decides to poke in and steal that data. Once all that personal data is stolen, it can be used against the breach victims for [identity](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/172_3203_equifax_complaint_7-22-19.pdf) [theft](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industr...
