# Llamafile

A single-file, declarative format for defining, distributing, and running reproducible LLM applications.

Author:
Mozilla

Since:
2023-09-10

[Visit Website](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/llamafile/) [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/llamafile)

## Detailed Introduction

Llamafile is a single-file, declarative distribution and runtime approach that lets developers package models, dependencies, and runtime parameters in one manifest, enabling consistent startup of LLM applications across local, container, and cloud environments. It lowers the friction of distributing and reproducing model-based applications and makes examples and workflows easier to share and reproduce.

## Main Features

* Single declarative file to describe models, dependencies, and runtime contracts for easy sharing and versioning.
* Consistent startup across local, container, and cloud environments to reduce environment drift.
* Compatibility with CI/CD and existing build tooling to integrate model delivery into engineering pipelines.

## Use Cases

* Package research models and experimental environments as reproducible single-file bundles for sharing and review.
* Rapidly deploy lightweight LLM services in edge or constrained environments with minimal operational overhead.
* Automate model verification in CI or use the file as a distribution artifact for model releases.

## Technical Features

* Lightweight declarative format expressing dependencies, I/O and runtime parameters, emphasizing portability and reproducibility.
* Designed to be runtime-agnostic and easily integrated with different orchestrators and tooling.
* Built for shareability and engineering workflows, serving as a foundation for model engineering, testing, and deployment.
