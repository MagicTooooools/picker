# DeXRAY v2.36

Posted on [2025-12-03](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/12/03/dexray-v2-36/ "9:10 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

[Brian](https://malwaremaloney.blogspot.com/) is one of the biggest supporters of DeXRAY, and for years he has been actively contributing to its improvements – by adding lots of new code, adding new features and fixing bugs.

In this release, Brian fixed a bug in a code handling Windows Defender files – the bug caused the decrypted files to have an incorrect size, and as a result – hashes.

Thanks Brian!
