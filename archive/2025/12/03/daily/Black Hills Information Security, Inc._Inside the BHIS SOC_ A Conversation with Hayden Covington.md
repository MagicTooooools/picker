What happens when you ditch the tiered ticket queues and replace them with collaboration, agility, and real-time response? In this interview, Hayden Covington takes us behind the scenes of the BHIS Security Operations Center—where analysts don’t escalate tickets, they solve them. Learn how this small, high-trust team works smarter, moves faster, and stops threats cold.

## ***What is a SOC?***

*Melissa:* For someone new to the world of cybersecurity, can you start by explaining what a SOC is?

*Hayden:* Sure. A SOC, or Security Operations Center, is like the nerve center for security monitoring. Traditionally, it functions kind of like a help desk with multiple tiers of analysts who escalate issues from one level to the next. Tier 1 handles the basic stuff, then passes anything complicated up to Tier 2 or Tier 3 if needed.

## ***How is BHIS’s SOC different from other SOCs?***

*Melissa:*So what makes BHIS’s SOC different?

*Hayden:* We don’t use that traditional tiered structure. Instead, any analyst can take a look at an alert and, if they need help, they reach out directly to someone more experienced. There’s no formal handoff process. And we’re deeply collaborative. Our analysts stay on calls with customers, even through full-blown incident responses, because they already have context. We’re more than just alert responders; we help customers solve the problem in real time.

*Melissa:* So it’s less about passing the buck and more about owning the issue?

*Hayden:* Exactly. We’re not just sending alerts. We’re partnering with our clients to respond quickly and thoroughly. It’s really a white-glove service, and I can say that what we offer is unmatched peace of mind.

## ***How does the BHIS SOC get access to logs and stuff?***

*Melissa:* How do you get the information that you need to actually make it all work?

*Hayden:* That’s a great question. The last SOC I worked at was all in one room, and if things got really bad, we could literally go downstairs and unplug a server. That was a government org, and that kind of break-glass emergency protocol was actually in the playbook. BHIS is a totally different model. If we bring down a customer server, we could be costing them money, so containment has to be smarter. Our SOC pulls everything into a centralized SIEM, so we can search logs from all our customers in one view. That means we don’t have to hop around between servers and organizations. It also helps us spot patterns across environments. In one case, we caught a piece of malware and then realized another customer had a very similar beacon, so we got to them early too.

## ***Where do you, Hayden, sit in the BHIS SOC?***

*Melissa:* What’s your role in the SOC?

*Hayden:* I run the operations side of the SOC. We recently restructured into two sides: engineering and operations. Engineering handles infrastructure—keeping everything running smoothly. Operations is where the alerts, detection engineering, and incident response live. I lead that team. We also have subgroups focused on things like threat hunting and automation.

*Melissa:* And who else is part of that structure?

*Hayden:* We’ve got an engineering lead and someone who channels customer communication, and also a couple of other SOC leads, so it’s a tight-knit and evolving team....
