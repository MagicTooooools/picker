# DOJ takes down Myanmar scam center website spoofing TickMill trading platform

The Department of Justice announced the dismantling of a website used by a scam center in Myanmar to siphon thousands of dollars from multiple victims.

An affidavit filed this week supported the domain seizure of tickmilleas.com — a spoof of legitimate forex and commodities trading platform TickMill.

The recently created Scam Center Strike Force tracked the fake website back to the prominent Tai Chang scam compound in Kyaukhat, Myanmar. This is the third domain taken down by U.S. officials in connection with the Tai Chang scam compound — which international law enforcement agencies [raided three weeks ago](https://therecord.media/strike-force-southeast-asia-scams).

The scammers used the fictitious TickMill domain to trick victims into depositing funds. The FBI said several victims used the domain and told agents that they were shown lucrative returns on what they thought were legitimate investments.

Victims were shown alleged deposits made by scammers into their accounts as proof that their money was growing on the platform.

“Despite the seized domains having been registered in early November 2025, the FBI has already identified multiple victims who used the domain in the last month to send cryptocurrency as part of what they believed were legitimate investments and were scammed out of their money,” the DOJ explained.

The domain also directed people to download apps allegedly connected to the website, and the FBI has notified Google and Apple of the fraudulent apps. Several of the apps were removed, according to the DOJ.

A law enforcement splash page has now been placed on the fake TickMill website.

The action comes as the U.S. has stepped up its actions against scam compounds across Southeast Asia that have siphoned billions from Americans through a variety of illicit schemes.

Through the Scam Center Strike Force, the FBI has deployed agents to Bangkok, where they are working alongside the Royal Thai Police to take down compounds like Tai Chang, which is on the border of Myanmar and Thailand.

Tai Chang is one of several scam centers run by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA), an armed group in Myanmar aligned with the military government. Last month, the DOJ tied the group’s scam operations to Chinese organized crime and several companies in Thailand [that have now been sanctioned](https://therecord.media/strike-force-southeast-asia-scams) by the Treasury Department.

The Scam Center Strike Force said its goal is to target the Chinese gangs and officials in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos that are running the scam compounds. The FBI estimates that the scam compounds steal about $10 billion from Americans each year through pig butchering schemes that typically begin with text messages or social media outreach.

The strike force also pledged to work with private tech companies to address the schemes. As part of the take down of Tai Chang, the group worked with Meta to remove about 2,000 accounts used as part of pig butchering schemes by Tai Chang scammers.
