## TL;DR

Barber to cyber in ~22 months. Free Labs → Google IT Support → AWS CCP → CAPSLOCK bootcamp → hands-on challenge → technical interview → Junior Responder → Cyber Security Response Engineer at JUMPSEC.

Practical steps, not magic.

### It all started with a casual chat in my barber’s chair.

One of my regular clients mentioned that he worked in cybersecurity.

Between trimming fades and lining edges, curiosity got the better of me.

“How do I get into what you do?” I asked.

He didn’t give me a long lecture or a list of expensive certifications. Instead, he kept it simple:

“Learn a bit about the field, try some hands-on labs, and see if it sticks. Check out Hack The Box and INE – start with the free paths.”

That was it. Simple advice. No pressure. Exactly what I needed.

That moment planted a seed.

[![jumpsec key](https://www.jumpsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/jumpsec-key.jpg)](https://www.jumpsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/jumpsec-key.jpg)

### Something about that conversation clicked.

The next day, I started looking into everything he mentioned. What began as a passing chat over clippers turned into a spark that changed my direction completely.

That moment in March 2022 lit the fuse that launched my journey into cybersecurity.

Two years after that conversation, in January 2024, I landed my first role in the field – Junior Cyber Security Responder.

Here’s what happened in between.

### The question of “How do I actually start?” kept echoing in my head.

I dove into research – reading about resources, certifications, interview prep, and what a solid tech CV should look like. Eventually, I landed on the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** as my first concrete step, a way to build a real foundation.

It wasn’t a quick process. It took almost a year to complete. Between work and life, study time was limited, but I kept going. Progress was slow, but it was steady.

Then one day, another client – a network admin – gave me the next push.

“Learn some Azure and AWS,” he said. “If you do, I’ll pass your CV to our HR when roles open up.”

That was all the motivation I needed. Two weeks later, I booked the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam and passed in March 2023 – my first real certification exam.

It might have been a small win on paper, but for me, it was proof. Proof that I could do this.
