# DDoS Guard: LaLiga’s Piracy Blocks Test Whether Anyone Will Protect the Internet

Internet infrastructure company DDoS-Guard is concerned by the power granted to Spain's LaLiga in its fight against piracy. Describing the scale of over-blocking as "astonishing", Dmitry Nikonov, Head of Web Application Protection, believes that LaLiga is becoming a private regulator, one with the authority to interfere with internet infrastructure. "Football matches have become the pretext for a large-scale internet experiment, testing whether there is anyone to protect its freedom."

A report published by the European Commission last month assessed whether its [Recommendation of May 2023](https://torrentfreak.com/the-battle-plan-for-combating-iptv-piracy-in-europe-has-arrived-230504/) had made a difference in the fight against pirated streams.

[No significant improvement](https://torrentfreak.com/live-sports-piracy-eu-commission-admits-that-anti-piracy-advice-had-limited-impact-251124/)” was the downbeat conclusion.

From the perspective of top-tier Spanish football league, LaLiga, new legislation is the only workable solution, and it needs to be implemented in Europe, sooner rather than later.

## LaLiga Claims to Have Slashed Piracy in Half, Give or Take

At the same time as urgently calling for new legislation, LaLiga claims to have reduced piracy of its content in Spain [by as much as 60%](https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-says-blocking-cut-piracy-by-40-60-focused-precise-without-collateral-impact-250528/). This was achieved *under existing legislation* for the season that concluded at the end of the summer. A 40% reduction, the lower figure previously cited by LaLiga, would still be unprecedented.

Yet, in the context of LaLiga’s court-ordered authority, which permits aggressive blocking of almost any site or service facilitating access to pirate streams of its premium content, such results are not *absolutely* impossible, at least in measured short bursts. LaLiga regularly laments Cloudflare’s refusal to prevent piracy platforms from using its services and for every week that remains the case, Cloudflare IP addresses – utilized by pirates and regular customers alike – are blocked by Spanish ISPs.

LaLiga reports that in May 2025, 38% of piracy involving LaLiga content “was distributed through Cloudflare’s infrastructure.” So at least on paper and without considering circumvention and other factors, aggressive yet effective blocking of Cloudflare would in theory be sufficient to claim a ~40% reduction in piracy rates.

The problem, which has thus far proven impossible to solve, is how blanket denial of service to piracy platforms can be executed without subjecting innocent parties to the same fate.

## Internet Private Security Guard

As Head of Web Application Protection at [DDoS-Guard](https://ddos-guard.net), a Russian Internet company providing protective online services, Dmitry Nikonov understands the importance of connectivity. Operating in broadly the same market as Cloudflare, DDoS-Guard has been paying close attention to the events playing out in Spain.

LaLiga’s legal authority allows it to block Cloudflare and in the event that DDoS-Guard’s services also become a concern, there would be no legal barrier to prevent it from being treated in much the same way. The consequences of non-compliance seem to have alarmed Nikonov.

“This is happening right now, in the fall of 2025, and the scale of this phenomenon is astonishing. It seems LaLiga is beyond control,” Nikonov writes in a column for [Forbes Russia](https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/550519-ne-odnih-piratov-udalaut-s-pola-laliga-kak-precedent-cifrovogo-castnogo-cenzora).

“LaLiga can essentially apply a ‘piracy’ mask to entire ranges of addresses, often affecting endpoints that are not directly related to illegal broadcasts.”

## ‘Private Regulation’ of the Internet

Nikonov believes the authority delegated to LaLiga should serve as a wake-up call for the global internet. He says that the authority to interfere with internet functioning has elevated the company to a powerful position; the big question is whether anyone can do anything about it.

“LaLiga is becoming a private regulator: not a state or an independent regulator, but a commercial organization that has delegated authority to interfere with network infrastructure. Football matches have become the pretext for a large-scale experiment on the internet, testing whether there is anyone to protect its freedom,” Nikonov says.

“If the football league has such powers today, then nothing will stop other major players from acquiring them tomorrow. We’re talking about media holdings, streaming companies, and corporations for whom content is not entertainment, but a source of profit.”

## Trade Barriers, No Legal Recourse

In a late October submission to the 2026 National Trade Assessment Report, [Cloudflare warned the Trump administration](https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-tells-u-s-govt-that-foreign-site-blocking-efforts-are-digital-trade-barriers/) that Spanish courts allow rightsholders to request “overbroad court orders” that cause collateral damage affecting tens of thousands of legitimate websites.

Since the Spanish government has chosen not to intervene, and “no judicial opportunity for remedy” currently exists, Cloudflare said that creates “significant trade barriers between the countries.”

Nikonov uses similar terms to those used in a Cloudflare-commissioned report [released in the summer](https://torrentfreak.com/the-risks-of-pirate-site-blocking-who-benefits-who-pays-and-at-what-cost-250729/). “The internet will become fragmented,” he says, before reminding readers that state institutions won’t be responsible, but commercial organizations shielded by government.

“This scheme avoids public debate (the Spanish parliament refused to consider the issue, citing a court ruling) and instead considers the proportionality of the measures. Under the guise of copyright protection, a tool is emerging that allows commercial players to directly influence the accessibility of parts of the internet, bypassing legal proceedings.

“Access to resources will be determined not by technical standards, but by the interests of private corporations with administrative resources,” he warns.

## More Powerful Tools Than Previously Reported?

Nikonov suggests that more powerful tools are being deployed in Spain, beyond simple DNS blocking. He claims that a key role belongs to the National Telecommunications Market Commission (CNMC), which, at the behest of LaLiga issues “mandatory directives” to all Spanish ISPs, urging “the fastest possible compliance.”

“[This] effectively forces them to implement DNS and BGP filtering. Border Gateway Protocol is the primary dynamic routing protocol on the internet,” ...
