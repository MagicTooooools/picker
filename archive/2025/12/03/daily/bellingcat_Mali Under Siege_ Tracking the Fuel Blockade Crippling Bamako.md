# Mali Under Siege: Tracking the Fuel Blockade Crippling Bamako

Attacks by a jihadist group on fuel convoys bound for Bamako, the capital of Mali, have destroyed more than 130 tankers since September, a Bellingcat investigation has found.

The systematic attacks by [Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/jamaa-nusrat-ul-islam-wa-al-muslimin-jnim) (JNIM) have brought Bamako and other regions of the West African nation to a standstill as the Al Qaeda-affiliated militia uses economic warfare to pressure the military government.

Landlocked Mali depends on fuel imports transported via tankers by road from neighbouring Senegal and Ivory Coast. Disrupting these convoys strikes directly at the country’s “economic core”, the independent global conflict monitor [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) said.

Mali has struggled to contain Islamist insurgent groups since a [rebellion](https://www.clingendael.org/pub/2015/the_roots_of_malis_conflict/) in the country’s north in 2012. Large swathes of the country remain outside government control despite the [junta’s pledges](https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250818-five-years-after-the-2020-coup-where-is-mali-today-assimi-goita) to root out jihadists. Since 2021, Bamako has relied heavily on a Russian security partnership, first with [Wagner](https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/sahel/mali-russia-internal/mali-and-russia-restructure-their-security-partnership-what-end) and now its Africa Corps successor [created](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/07/africa-corps-wagner-group-russia-africa-burkina-faso/) by the Russian Ministry of Defense, after [cutting ties](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/the-un-peacekeeping-mission-in-mali-ends-after-10-years-following-the-juntas-pressure-to-go#:~:text=BAMAKO%2C%20Mali%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94,in%20the%20West%20African%20nation) with French and UN peacekeeping missions.

JNIM, an Islamist coalition affiliated with Al Qaeda, has been designated as a [terrorist organisation](https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/what-australia-is-doing/terrorist-organisations/listed-terrorist-organisations/jamaat-nusrat-al-islam-wal-muslimin) by several countries including the [United States](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations), United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Mostly active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, it has become one of Africa’s [deadliest militant groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4r5wylwq6o).

Bellingcat has used open source methods to track the JNIM blockade across key supply routes in Mali, verifying evidence of six separate attacks across three regions between mid-September and early November which destroyed more than 130 fuel tankers.

Héni Nsaibia, senior West Africa analyst at ACLED, said the campaign marked an escalation of JNIM’s economic warfare tactics, which are aimed at weakening the military regime by undermining its legitimacy.

While the blockade has not caused a high death toll, Nsaibia said the economic and social repercussions were severe, with fuel shortages disrupting trade and transport across much of the country. It is “a humiliation for the military regime in Bamako, which has been unable to secure the country’s main trade and supply routes,” the analyst told Bellingcat.

## A Communications War

Monitoring conflict in West Africa’s Sahel region is especially difficult due to limited digital connectivity, restricted access for journalists, and state controls on reporting. Yet the blockade has generated a large volume of verifiable online material, making it possible to track using open source methods.

JNIM hosts its main media channel on ChirpWire, an encrypted social media application. The group set out its long-term ambitions on the platform on Nov. 20, Jacob Boswall, a senior journalist at BBC Monitoring who analyses jihadist propaganda in the Sahel, told Bellingcat. JNIM urged Malians, and Bamako residents in particular, to rise up and establish an Islamist government based on Sharia.

The group’s “communications are now predominantly in video format – a shift from the previous written statements,” Boswall said. Since September, videos posted to JNIM channels and circulated on social media show a series of attacks on fuel convoys in southern Mali. These posts, Nsaibia said, were intended to “directly undermine the centre of power, where the regime’s credibility is most at stake.”

In [a televised address](https://www.maliweb.net/video/discours-a-la-nation-du-22-septembre-2025-du-president-de-la-transition-le-general-darmee-assimi-goita-chef-de-letat-3109468.html) the night before Independence Day on Sep. 22, the country’s military leader, Colonel Assimi Goïta, urged people to “resist disinformation campaigns orchestrated by armed terrorist groups”. Nsaibia told Bellingcat that the launch of a new media channel highlighting operations by JNIM in the country’s south shows “a deliberate calibration of the group’s public messaging” toward southern audiences, including the junta’s core support base.

## Mapping the Siege

Bellingcat verified half a dozen JNIM attacks on fuel convoys in Mali, finding open source
evidence of more than 130 burnt-out tankers on four separate routes, illustrating the scale of
the campaign. It must be noted that it was not possible to match all the torched vehicles
visible in the satellite imagery with vehicles seen in footage posted online.

Follow a detailed timeline of the attacks by scrolling through this map, you can interact with
it by clicking incident dates or by zooming and dragging.

Three attacks occurred northwest of Bamako against convoys arriving from Senegal, with two
taking place less than 70 km from the capital.

The other three attacks took place southeast of Bamako, and targeted convoys travelling up from
Ivory Coast.

On Sept. 14, fighters ambushed a fuel convoy traveling from Senegal in the region of Kayes.
Videos recorded by fighters and people at the scene show dozens of burning and destroyed
tankers. One video shows a tanker engulfed in flames and exploding, and insurgents firing
machine guns at vehicles which spray fuel through multiple bullet holes.
