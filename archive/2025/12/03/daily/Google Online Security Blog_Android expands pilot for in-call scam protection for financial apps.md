Android uses the best of Google AI and our advanced security expertise to tackle mobile scams from every angle. Over the last few years, we’ve launched industry-leading features to detect scams and protect users across [phone calls, text messages](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/new-ai-powered-scam-detection-features.html) and [messaging app chat notifications](https://blog.google/products/pixel/november-2025-pixel-drop/).

These efforts are making a real difference in the lives of Android users. According to a recent YouGov [survey](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html)[1](#fn1) commissioned by Google, Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to report they had not received any scam texts in the prior week[2](#fn2).

But our work doesn’t stop there. Scammers are continuously evolving, using more sophisticated social engineering tactics to trick users into sharing their phone screen while on the phone to visit malicious websites, reveal sensitive information, send funds or download harmful apps. One popular scam involves criminals impersonating banks or other trusted institutions on the phone to try to manipulate victims into sharing their screen in order to reveal banking information or make a financial transfer.

To help combat these types of financial scams, we [launched a pilot earlier this year in the UK](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/whats-new-in-android-security-privacy-2025.html) focused on in-call protections for financial apps.

**How the in-call scam protection works on Android**

When you launch a participating financial app while screen sharing and on a phone call with a number that is not saved in your contacts, your Android device[3](#fn3) will automatically warn you about the potential dangers and give you the option to end the call and to stop screen sharing with just one tap. The warning includes a 30-second pause period before you’re able to continue, which helps break the ‘spell’ of the scammer's social engineering, disrupting the false sense of urgency and panic commonly used to manipulate you into a scam.

**Bringing in-call scam protections to more users on Android**

The UK pilot of Android’s in-call scam protections has already helped thousands of users end calls that could have cost them a significant amount of money. Following this success, and alongside recently launched pilots with financial apps in [Brazil](https://blog.google/intl/pt-br/produtos/android-chrome-play/novas-protecoes-contra-roubo-e-fraude-comecando-pelo-brasil/) and [India](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/company-news/protecting-vulnerable-audiences-is-at-the-heart-of-ai-safety-efforts/), we’ve now expanded this protection to most major UK banks.

We’ve also started to pilot this protection with more app types, including peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps. Today, we’re taking the next step in our expansion by rolling out a pilot of this protection in the United States[4](#fn4) with a number of popular fintechs like Cash App and banks, including JPMorganChase.

We are committed to collaborating across the ecosystem to help keep people safe from scams. We look forward to learning from these pilots and bringing these critical safeguards to even more users in the future.
