# Fileless protection explained: Blocking the invisible threat others miss

Most antivirus software for personal users scans your computer for malware hiding in files. This is, after all, how most malware is traditionally spread. But what about attacks that never create files? Fileless malware is a fast-growing threat that evades traditional antivirus software, because simply, it’s looking for files that don’t exist.

Here’s how Malwarebytes goes beyond signature scans and file analysis to catch those fileless threats hiding on your family’s computers.

## **What are fileless attacks?**

Most malware leaves a trail. It drops files on your hard drive so it can survive when you restart your computer. Those files are what traditional antivirus software hunts for.

Fileless attacks play by different rules, living only in your computer’s active memory. This means they vanish when you reboot, but they do their damage before that happens.

Fileless attacks don’t bring in their own files at all. Instead, they hijack legitimate Windows tools that your computer already trusts. PowerShell, for example, is a built-in program that helps Windows run everyday tasks. Fileless malware slips into memory, runs harmful commands through tools like PowerShell, and blends in with normal system activity.

Because Windows sees these tools as safe, it doesn’t throw up red flags. And because there are no malicious files saved to the disk, traditional antivirus has nothing to scan or quarantine, missing them completely.

Fileless attacks are becoming more common because they work. Cybercriminals use them to steal your passwords, freeze your files for ransom, or turn your computer into a cryptocurrency-mining machine without you knowing.

## **How Malwarebytes stops these invisible attacks**

Malwarebytes takes a different approach. Instead of just scanning files on your hard drive, we watch what programs are actually doing in your computer’s memory. We developed comprehensive protection creating a defense system that works in two powerful ways:

**Defense Layer 1: Script Monitoring**

Script Monitoring catches dangerous code before it runs. Whether it’s PowerShell, VBScript, JavaScript, or other scripts, we inspect them the moment they try to execute. Malicious? Blocked instantly. Safe? Runs normally.

Attackers scramble their malicious code so it looks like gibberish. Imagine a secret message where every letter is shifted three places in the alphabet. Our technology automatically decodes these scrambled commands, revealing what they’re really up to.

**Defense Layer 2: Command-Line Protection**

Command-Line Protection tracks what programs are trying to do when they run commands on your system.

When programs like PowerShell, Windows Script Host, or other command tools run, we examine what they’re trying to do. Are they downloading files from suspicious websites? Trying to modify system files? Attempting to turn off security software? We catch these patterns even if attackers try to bypass the first layer of defense.

## What might a **fileless attack look like?**

Let’s look at specific attack scenarios and how Malwarebytes protects you:
