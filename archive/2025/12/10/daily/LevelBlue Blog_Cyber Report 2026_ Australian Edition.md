In 2026, I expect the Australian cybersecurity landscape to look less like a loose collection of tools and more like a contested systems market where a handful of platforms quietly run the show.

After 20 years in this industry, I can see the center of gravity shifting from individual point products to integrated decision engines that sit across identity, data and operations. The Australian cyber strategy out to [2030](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/cyber-security/strategy/2023-2030-australian-cyber-security-strategy) is already pushing the industry toward coordinated outcomes rather than box ticking, and that pressure will only intensify as boards expect resilience, not just compliance.

On tooling, the consolidation trend is now impossible to ignore. The open extended detection and response story is moving from marketing language to practical necessity as security teams drown in parallel consoles, duplicate alerts and conflicting analytics.

The most successful platforms will be those that treat telemetry as a common data fabric, not as a proprietary moat. The market for artificial intelligence assisted security is on track to roughly quadruple globally by the end of the decade, and vendors that can prove real reduction in mean time to detect and respond rather than just nicer dashboards will win the budget arguments.

### A Maturing Market

[Accenture’s](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-to-acquire-cybercx-expanding-cybersecurity-capabilities-in-asia-pacific) acquisition of CyberCX is the clearest signal yet that the Australian market has matured into a strategic cyber hub rather than a regional outpost.
