Age verification laws are proliferating fast across the United States and around the world, creating a dangerous and confusing tangle of rules about what we’re all allowed to see and do online. Though these mandates claim to [protect children](http://eff.org/pages/age-verification-wont-protect-children#main-content), in practice they create harmful censorship and surveillance regimes that put [everyone](http://eff.org/pages/whos-harmed-age-verification-mandates#main-content)—adults and young people alike—at risk.

The term “age verification” is colloquially used to describe a [wide range](http://eff.org/pages/age-verification-estimation-assurance-oh-my-guide-terminology#main-content) of age assurance technologies, from age verification systems that force you to upload government ID, to age estimation tools that scan your face, to systems that infer your age by making you share personal data.
