# GhostFrame phishing kit fuels widespread attacks against millions

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 10, 2025

![spooky frame](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/framed_ghost.png?w=1200)

GhostFrame is a new phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kit, tracked since September 2025, that has already powered more than a million phishing attacks.

[Threat analysts](https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/12/04/threat-spotlight-ghostframe-phishing-kit) spotted a series of phishing attacks featuring tools and techniques they hadn’t seen before. A few months later, they had linked over a million attempts to this same kit, which they named GhostFrame for its stealthy use of iframes. The kit hides its malicious activity inside iframes loaded from constantly changing subdomains.

An iframe is a small browser window embedded inside a web page, allowing content to load from another site without sending you away–like an embedded YouTube video or a Google Map. That embedded bit is usually an iframe and is normally harmless.

GhostFrame abuses it in several ways. It dynamically generates a unique subdomain for each victim and can rotate subdomains even during an active session, undermining domain‑based detection and blocking. It also includes several anti‑analysis tricks: disabling right‑click, blocking common keyboard shortcuts, and interfering with browser developer tools, which makes it harder for analysts or cautious users to inspect what is going on behind the scenes.

As a PhaaS kit, GhostFrame is able to spoof legitimate services by adjusting page titles and favicons to match the brand being impersonated. This and its detection-evasion techniques show how PhaaS developers are innovating around web architecture (iframes, subdomains, streaming features) and not just improving email templates.

Hiding sign-in forms inside non‑obvious features (like image streaming or large‑file handlers) is another attempt to get around static content scanners. Think of it as attackers hiding a fake login box inside a “video player” instead of putting the login box directly on the page, so many security tools don’t realize it’s a login box at all. Those tools are often tuned to look for normal HTML forms and password fields in the page code, and here the sensitive bits are tucked away in a feature that is supposed to handle big image or file data streams.

Normally, an image‑streaming or large‑file function is just a way to deliver big images or other “binary large objects” (BLOBs) efficiently to the browser. Instead of putting the login form directly on the page, GhostFrame turns it into what looks like image data. To the user, it looks just like a real Microsoft 365 login screen, but to a basic scanner reading the HTML, it looks like regular, harmless image handling.

Generally speaking, the rise of GhostFrame illuminates a trend that PhaaS is arming less-skilled cybercriminals while raising the bar for defenders. We recently covered [Sneaky 2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/attackers-are-using-sneaky-2fa-to-create-fake-sign-in-windows-that-look-real) and [Lighthouse](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/1-million-victims-17500-fake-sites-google-takes-on-toll-fee-scammers) as examples of PhaaS kits that are extremely popular among attackers.

## So, what can we do?

Pairing a password manager with [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa) offers the best protection.

But as always, you’re the first line of defense. Don’t cl...
