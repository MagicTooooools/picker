NBCUniversal is doing all it can to identify the person(s) behind a series of high-profile leaks of the film Minions 3, which is scheduled to come out on July 1, 2026. Through DMCA subpoenas, both Google and Reddit are compelled to hand over the personal details of several account holders.

In October, several Reddit posts appeared online that supposedly linked to a leaked copy of the Minions 3 audio.

These postings were swiftly [removed by Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/despicableme/comments/1oilolv/minions_3_2026_movie_audio_only/), presumably after they were targeted by DMCA takedown notices, but the user kept submitting new posts.

The leaker, known as DrChoclateBob on Reddit, also relied on YouTube to share the audio using the “CHOCOLATE BOB” and “ChoclateBob” handles. These uploads were also spotted by rightsholders and were eventually removed.

Despite multiple warnings and strikes, the leaker continued sharing copies on YouTube, Google Drive, and elsewhere.

Eventually, this resulted in account terminations on Reddit [and YouTube](https://torrentfreak.com/images/bobgone.png), after which the calm returned.

## NBCUniversal Goes After DrChoclateBob

The leaked audio was [reportedly](https://toonado.com/movies/minions-3-titled-minions-monsters-has-leaked-online-in-its-entirety-following-recent-test-screening-a10007) recorded during a test screening. With more than half a year to go before the official premiere, it’s understandable that distributor Universal Pictures would like to know who leaked it.

To find out more, NBCUniversal requested two DMCA subpoenas at a California federal court this week, targeting Reddit and Google.

The subpoenas, which were swiftly signed off on by a court clerk, require both companies to share all identifying information that’s linked to the leaker’s accounts, including names, physical addresses, IP addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses.

## Plugging Leaks

It’s worth noting legal paperwork also mentions a potentially unrelated YouTube user, mightyvortex5973, who allegedly uploaded a pirated copy of The Lorax. That said, the primary focus of the subpoenas is clearly on protecting the “pre-release film content”.

Whether this DrChoclateBob recorded the audio or if they received it from someone else is something Universal would like to know.

While requesting the subpoena, NBCUniversal said that it would use the requested information to protect its rights. Whether this means that it will take follow-up legal action is unknown, but it is certainly determined to stop future leaks.
