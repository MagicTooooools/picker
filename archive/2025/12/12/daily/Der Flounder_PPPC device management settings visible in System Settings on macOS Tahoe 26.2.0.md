As part of the [What’s new for enterprise in macOS Tahoe 26](https://support.apple.com/124963) release notes for macOS Tahoe 26.2.0, there’s this note:

***App privacy permissions configured by device management are now shown in System Settings > Privacy & Security.***

![](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/screenshot-2025-12-12-at-1.07.png?w=595 "Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 1.07.png")

What this indicates is that a long-standing feature request by Mac admins has been fulfilled by Apple. For more details, please see below the jump.

As part of macOS 10.14 Mojave, [Apple introduced a number of privacy controls for user data](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/technical-articles/page/Preparing_Your_Organization_for_User_Data_Protections_on_macOS_10-14.html). At the same time, Apple also introduced device management options to allow [authorized applications to access data protected by those privacy controls](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/privacy-preferences-policy-control-payload-dep38df53c2a/web). These permissions are referred to collectively as Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) and are deployed via management profiles from an MDM server. However, up until macOS Tahoe 26.2, there was no way to see in the **Privacy & Security** section of System Settings which applications had which permissions granted via PPPC management profiles.

As an example, by default, Macs managed by Jamf Pro will get a management profile which allows the Jamf agent permission to access data stored in the user home folder via the PPPC permission known as [full disk access](https://support.jamf.com/en/articles/11004245-grant-full-disk-access-for-application-or-process-name). Here’s how this looks on macOS Tahoe 26.1.0:

Privacy Preferences Policy Control profile installed which enables full disk access to the Jamf agent.

No mention of the full disk access permissions granted to the Jamf agent in the **Privacy & Security** section of System Settings.

![](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/screenshot-2025-12-12-at-3.56.08pm.png?w=595 "Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 3.56.08 PM.png")

How this looks on macOS Tahoe 26.2.0:

Privacy Preferences Policy Control profile installed which enables full disk access for the Jamf agent.

Full disk access permissions granted to the Jamf agent is disclosed in the **Privacy & Security** section of System Settings. It is also disclosed that the permissions setting is configured by a profile.

   Please note, if you deploy a profile to allow standard users on macOS to approve screen recording permissions for specific apps (i.e. <https://github.com/poundbangbash/community-screenrecording-pppc-profile>), in macOS 26.2, the On/Off Status for these apps will not be correctly displayed. Apple is aware of this, but please file Feedback and/or open an AppleCare ticket.
