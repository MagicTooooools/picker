# Google ads funnel Mac users to poisoned AI chats that spread the AMOS infostealer

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 12, 2025

[Researchers](https://www.huntress.com/blog/amos-stealer-chatgpt-grok-ai-trust) have found evidence that AI conversations were inserted in Google search results to mislead macOS users into installing the [Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/osx-atomicstealer). Both Grok and ChatGPT were found to have been abused in these attacks.

Forensic investigation of an AMOS alert showed the infection chain started when the user ran a Google search for “clear disk space on macOS.” Following that trail, the researchers found not one, but two poisoned AI conversations with instructions. Their testing showed that similar searches produced the same type of results, indicating this was a deliberate attempt to infect Mac users.

The search results led to AI conversations which provided clearly laid out instructions to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command would end with the machine being infected with the AMOS malware.

If that sounds familiar, you may have read our post about [sponsored search results that led to fake macOS software on GitHub](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/fake-malwarebytes-lastpass-and-others-on-github-serve-malware). In that campaign, sponsored ads and SEO-poisoned search results pointed users to GitHub pages impersonating legitimate macOS software, where attackers provided step-by-step instructions that ultimately installed the AMOS infostealer.

As the researchers pointed out:

> “Once the victim executed the command, a multi-stage infection chain began. The base64-encoded string in the Terminal command decoded to a URL hosting a malicious bash script, the first stage of an AMOS deployment designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and establish persistence without ever triggering a security warning.”

This is dangerous for the user on many levels. Because there is no prompt or review, the user does not get a chance to see or assess what the downloaded script will do before it runs. It bypasses security because of the use of the command line, it can bypass normal file download protections and execute anything the attacker wants.

[Other researchers](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/share-chatgpt-chat-clickfix-macos-amos-infostealer/54928/) have found a campaign that combines elements of both attacks: the shared AI conversation and fake software install instructions. They found user guides for installing OpenAI’s new Atlas browser for macOS through shared ChatGPT conversations, which in reality led to AMOS infections.

## So how does this work?

The cybercriminals used prompt engineering to get ChatGPT to generate a step‑by‑step “installation/cleanup” guide which in reality will infect a system. ChatGPT’s sharing feature creates a public link to a single conversation that exists in the owner’s account. Attackers can craft a chat to produce the instructions they need and then tidy up the visible conversation so that what’s shared looks like a short, clean guide rather than a long back-and-forth.

Most major chat interfaces (including Grok on X) also let users delete conversations or selectively share screenshots. That makes it easy for criminals to present only the polished, “helpful” part of a conversation and hide how they arrived there.
