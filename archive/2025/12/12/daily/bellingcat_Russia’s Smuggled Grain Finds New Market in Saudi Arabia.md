# Russia’s Smuggled Grain Finds New Market in Saudi Arabia

A joint investigation by Bellingcat and Lloyd’s List has identified Saudi Arabia as the newest country to import grain directly from a Western-sanctioned port in occupied Crimea, as Russia attempts to secure recognition of the Ukrainian territory via a US-led peace plan.

Satellite imagery and Automated Identification System (AIS) data from Lloyd’s List Intelligence shows the bulk carrier Krasnodar (IMO: 9296781) sailed from Avlita Grain Terminal in Sevastopol to Saudi Arabia on two occasions between September and November 2025. Bellingcat confirmed Krasnodar’s journeys ended at Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah Port in September and the Port of Jazan in November.

These journeys show that Saudi Arabia has joined buyers in Iran, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, Venezuela and Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen who are willing to accept what the Ukrainian government describes as “stolen” grain.

## Black Sea

Krasnodar goes dark – an AIS gap lasting more than two weeks begins on August 22.

## Occupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol

Imagery shows Krasnodar docked at Berth 21 of the Avlita grain terminal at the Port of Sevastopol on August 27.

## Black Sea

Krasnodar turns its AIS back on in the Black Sea, as required to transit the Bosphorus on September 6.

## Bosphorus Strait

Krasnodar transits the Bosphorus. Judging by the draft, with no visible red paint on its hull, the ship appears to be fully laden.

## Saudi Arabia: King Abdullah Port

Imagery (as well as AIS data) shows Krasnodar docked at the King Abdullah Port. A pile of what appears to be grain is visible to the right of the image on September 18.

## Bosphorus Strait

Returning via the Suez Canal, Krasnodar transits through the Bosphorus on September 28 with its red paint fully visible, indicating it is not heavily laden.

## Black Sea

Krasnodar goes dark – an AIS gap lasting more than one week begins on October 6.

## Occupied Crimea: Port of Sevastopol

Satellite imagery shows Krasnodar docked, with its hatches open, at Berth 21 of the Avlita grain terminal on October 8.

## Black Sea

Krasnodar turns its AIS back on in the Kerch strait. After a few days loitering in the Kerch strait, it transits through the Bosphorus.

## Bosphorus Strait

With no red paint visible and the Plimsoll line near maximum draft, the vessel appears to be fully laden when it transits the Bosphorus on October 26.

## Saudi Arabia: Jazan City

AIS data shows Krasnodar docked at Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries for seven days. Planet imagery captured it on November 6.

After leaving Jazan, Krasnodar returned to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus on November 23.

It stopped transmitting AIS for a third time on November 24 for nine days and has been intermittently transmitting data since.

Krasnodar was again captured in satellite imagery docked at the Avlita terminal in Sevastopol on November 26.

## Petrokhleb-Kuban Denies Visiting Avlita Terminal

Documents accessed on [Russia’s federal registry](https://fedresurs.ru/sfactmessages/60564EFBD0D4479A9EF84AE884D87AD0) indicate the vessel is leased by Russian firm [Petrokhleb-Kuban](https://petrokhleb.com/english/), a major player in Russian and international grain markets.

Petrokhleb Kuban told Bellingcat it “categorically denies any allegations of involvement in the theft of grain from Ukrainian regions”.

It added that Petrokhleb-Kuban does not export grain from the Avlita terminal to any country.

“Petrokhleb-Kuban does not operate at the port of Avlita and does not ship grain from there. All grain shipped by Petrokhleb-Kuban is produced by Russian farmers,” a spokesperson said.

“The vessel Krasnodar follows all widely accepted safety protocols and does not disable its AIS while on passage. The AIS signal in the Black Sea is being jammed by the military due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.”

The spokesperson also said the vessel Krasnodar was loading barley at the port of Kavkaz, “as confirmed by bills of lading and port clearance.”

AIS interference is rampant in the Black Sea, however, instances of jamming typically do not last more than a couple of days. Further, third-party disruptions impact all vessels in one area indiscriminately.

Bellingcat reviewed the AIS traces of vessels sailing near Krasnodar. In both voyages, Krasnodar was the only vessel in that area that stopped transmitting AIS data for that period of time.

Bellingcat also checked available Planet Labs PBC and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery covering the grain terminal in Port Kavkaz during the two periods of August and October where Krasnodar has absent or unreliable AIS coverage and found no vessels matching the length of the Krasnodar.

Bellingcat identified Krasnodar in Avlita terminal on three occasions, by cross referencing satellite images of Krasnodar and recent images and video of the ship. Krasnodar was last detected at Avlita terminal in satellite imagery on November 26, again with its AIS switched off.  Krasnodar’s chimney is navy blue in colour, except for a white band on the left, right, and front side of the chimney. The ship’s other features – five grey hatches, four grey cranes, a red deck, a green floor on the bridge, all visually match known images of the ship.

Finally, the ship’s me...
