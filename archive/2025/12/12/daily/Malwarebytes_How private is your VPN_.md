# How private is your VPN?

When you’re shopping around for a Virtual Private Network (VPN) you’ll find yourself in a sea of promises like “military-grade encryption!” and “total anonymity!” You can’t scroll two inches without someone waving around these fancy terms.

But not all VPNs can be trusted. Some VPNs genuinely protect your privacy, and some only sound like they do.

With VPN usage rising around the world for streaming, travel, remote work, and basic digital safety, understanding what makes [a VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) truly private matters more than ever.

After years of trying VPNs for myself, privacy-minded family members, and a few mission-critical projects, here’s what I wish everyone knew.

## Why do you even need a VPN?

If you’re wondering whether a VPN is worth it, you’re not alone. As your privacy-conscious consumer advocate, let me break down three time-saving and cost-saving benefits of using a privacy-first VPN.

### Keep your browsing private

Ever feel like someone’s always looking over your shoulder online? Without a VPN, your internet service provider, and sometimes websites or governments, can keep tabs on what you do. A VPN encrypts your traffic and swaps out your real [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) for one of its own, letting you browse, shop, and read without a digital paper trail following you around.

I’ve run into this myself while traveling. There were times when I needed a VPN just to access US or European web apps that were blocked in certain Asian countries. In other cases, I preferred to appear “based” in the US so that English-language apps would load naturally, instead of defaulting to the local language, currency, or content of the country I was visiting.

### Watch what you want, but pay less

Some of your favorite shows and websites are locked away simply because of where you live. In many cases, subscription or pay-per-view prices are higher in more prosperous regions. With a VPN, you can connect to servers in other countries and unlock content that isn’t available at home.

For example, when All Elite Wrestling (AEW) announced its major 2022 pay-per-view featuring CM Punk vs. Jon Moxley, US fans paid $49.99 through Bleacher Report. Fans in the UK, meanwhile, watched the exact same event on FiteTV for $23 less, around half the price. Because platforms determine pricing based on your IP address, a VPN server in another region can show you the pricing available in that country. Savings like that can make a VPN pay for itself quickly.

### Stay safe on coffee-shop Wi-Fi

Before you join a network named “Starbucks Guest WiFi,” remember that nothing stops a cybercriminal from broadcasting a hotspot with the same name. Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but it’s also one of the easiest places for someone to snoop on your traffic.

Connecting to your VPN immediately encrypts everything you send or receive. That means you can check email, pay bills, or browse privately without worrying about someone nearby intercepting your information. Getting compromised will cost far more in money, time, and stress than most privacy-first VPN subscriptions.

## But what actually makes a VPN privacy-first?

For a VPN, “privacy-first” can’t be just a nice slogan. It’s a mindset that shapes every technical, business, and le...
