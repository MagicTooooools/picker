The ['State of Threat Modeling 2024-2025'](https://www.threatmodelingconnect.com/state-of-threat-modeling-2024-25) from Threat Modeling Connect is now live!

This is the first-ever, community-powered report on the current state of threat modeling. This report would not be possible without the community. From practitioners to policymakers to industry experts, 60+ organizations provided insights about practical benchmarks and recommendations.

Looking for a sneak peek?

* **STRIDE is still the most common approach**, with 88% of survey respondents selecting STRIDE as a part of their company strategy.
* **System designs are essential**, with even 37% of organizations citing diagrams as a main source of information to identify threats.
* **Ready for a third?** Read the full report [here](https://www.threatmodelingconnect.com/state-of-threat-modeling-2024-25)!

We want to emphasize how the 'State of Threat Modeling' was a community effort. After reading this year's issue, we urge you to take the [2025-2026 survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXgRR4bJQDlBH40eVE4KWzLhLHp5hM1DHhLcV_01dpq0_09A/viewform) to help in the data collection. Your insight is valuable, and we look forward to hearing from you!
