# The US digital doxxing of H-1B applicants is a massive privacy misstep

by [Mark Beare](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mbearemalwarebytes-com) |
December 12, 2025

![US Department of State](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/departmentofstate.jpg?w=1200)

Technology professionals hoping to come and work in the US face a new privacy concern. Starting December 15, skilled workers on H-1B visas and their families must flip their social media profiles to public before their consular interviews. It’s a deeply risky move from a security and privacy perspective.

According to a [missive](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/announcement-of-expanded-screening-and-vetting-for-h-1b-and-dependent-h-4-visa-applicants.html) from the US State Department, immigration officers use all available information to vet newcomers for signs that they pose a threat to national security. That includes an “online presence review.” That review now requires not just H-1B applicants but also H-4 applicants (their dependents who want to move with them to the US) to “adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to ‘public.'”

An internal State Department cable [obtained by CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-announces-new-guidelines-for-vetting-student-visa-applicants-social-media/) had sharper language: it instructs officers to screen for “any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.” What that means is unclear, but if your friends like posting strong political opinions, you [should be worried](https://archive.ph/40YJ4#selection-525.0-554.0).

This isn’t the first time that the government has forced people to lift the curtain on their private digital lives. The US State Department [forced](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/announcement-of-expanded-screening-and-vetting-for-visa-applicants/) student visa applicants to make their social media profiles public in June this year.

This is a big deal for a lot of people. The H-1B program allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty jobs. The US processed around 400,000 visas under the H-1B program last year, most of which were applications to renew employment, [according to the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/04/what-we-know-about-the-us-h-1b-visa-program/). When you factor in those workers’ dependents, we’re talking well over a million people. This decision forces them into long-term digital exposure that threatens not just them, but the US too.

## Why forced public exposure is a security disaster

A lot of these H-1B workers work for defense contractors, chip makers, AI labs, and big tech companies. These are organizations that foreign powers (especially those hostile to the US) care a lot about, and that makes those H-1B employees primary targets for them.

Making H-1B holders’ real names, faces, and daily routines public is a form of digital doxxing. The policy exposes far more personal information than is safe, creating significant new risks.

This information gives these actors a free organizational chart, complete with up-to-date information on who’s likely to be working on chip designs and sensitive software.

It also gives the same people all they need to target people on that chart. They have information on H-1B holders and their dependents, including intelligence about their friends and family, their interests, their regular locations, and even what kinds of technology they use. They become more exposed to...
