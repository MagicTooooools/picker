# Better Agents

An open-source project to help users evaluate, compare, and improve AI agent frameworks.

Author:
Langwatch

Since:
2025-04-19

[GitHub](https://github.com/langwatch/better-agents)

## Detailed Introduction

Better Agents is a community-maintained open-source project designed to help developers evaluate, compare, and improve AI agent frameworks. The project provides comparative metrics, best-practice guidance, and actionable improvement suggestions to help engineering teams weigh trade-offs among different agent implementations and accelerate building reliable automated agent systems.

## Main Features

* Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for comparing design trade-offs across agent implementations.
* Curated best practices and common pitfalls to help teams avoid implementation mistakes.
* Actionable improvement recommendations to incrementally optimize performance and reliability on existing frameworks.
* Engineering-oriented focus, enabling conclusions to be applied in CI/CD and deployment scenarios.

## Use Cases

* Rapidly compare multiple agent frameworks during selection and form a decision basis.
* Identify improvement areas in existing agent platforms to improve reliability or reduce cost.
* Serve as a reference for research and engineering reproducibility to validate design choices in practical scenarios.

## Technical Features

* Emphasizes engineering evaluation metrics such as reliability, observability, and maintainability.
* Provides pragmatic improvement paths rather than pure theoretical discussion, facilitating CI/CD integration.
* Community-driven documentation and case collection for continuous updates and real-world validation.
* Aims for compatibility with open protocols and tooling to integrate with the existing agent ecosystem.
