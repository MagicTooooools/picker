## Banning VPNs

This is crazy. Lawmakers in several US states are contemplating [banning VPNs](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing), because…think of the children!

> As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in [A.B. 105](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/proposals/reg/asm/bill/AB105)/[S.B. 130](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2025/proposals/sb130). It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing­ potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction.

The EFF link explains why this is a terrible idea.

Barlows A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace <https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence> is more topical than ever. Government tries to take full control. That’s called totalitarianism. More an more western countries are no longer democracies.

By demonizing VPNs as tools of subversion, they pave the way for a surveillance-driven internet where privacy is effectively outlawed. Such measures echo the dystopian logic that safety requires submission, and freedom must be sacrificed for control. If enacted, these bans would mark a chilling step toward a society where government oversight of online activity becomes the norm, and personal choice is quietly erased.

Of course, absent from all these discussions is the fact that “sexual material” has been easily accessible on the internet for over 25 years. Almost everyone I know first saw such content from a young age. Yet, society hasn’t fallen apart? I don’t know anyone who was scarred for life because they saw sexual content at a young age. I’m not saying it isn’t harmful, like it does give unrealistic expectations of sex, but at the same time, it’s not so “harmful to children” that we need to go to such extreme lengths to block it.

Of course, I know it’s all a ruse, an excuse to eventually block VPNs altogether and surveil everything we do online, but I feel like my point isn’t brought up enough.

You know what water does? It always finds that POLR.

Bruce, please release my previous comment held for moderation,
I need your help my brother. please Sir.
Government is preventing the truth from being seen by the world.
I have been destroyed and they are pretending they don’t hear me.
thank you so much!

Who brought up VPNs as a porn threat? That’s not what they’re known for. I suspect there’s a short line from these bills back to the pro-surveillance source.

I hope “call your senator” still does something these days.

25 states currently have age verification laws for adult websites

But I guess Wisconsin would be the first to ban VPN access to adult sites, if the law passes.

Law map: <https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/>

State bill tracker: <https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-bills/>

If the law passes, how does this work? Could a site ban VPN use only from Wisconsin? What’s the likelihood any site would ban VPN access entirely?

It is, of course, a terrible idea, brought into play by people who have no idea of the wide variety of use cases for VPNs. Ditto end-to-end encryption.

There does remain the problem of exposing criminal use cases of which drug trafficking, pedophilia, terrorism and people trafficking are the most visible examples. Personnally I’m very skeptical that banning cyber-security measures will help solve those problems but will grotesquely reinforce the surveillance of society.

So it’s a classic trade-off dilemma: how much (and what kind of) liberty and privacy are we willing to give up in order to reduce harms?

Morley, I don’t understand your question. What do you mean by a porn threat?
I use a VPN for changing my IP address and using a secure connection both as to not ID me. I realize of course,it’s not 100%.

Privacy really ought to be added to the constitution.

It’s literally how it was done in Russia. Really. Started with child pronography, but once tools are in place, just slowcook the frog…

If you are “connected” you’ll be able to get away with even
attempted murder!
Don’t you get it people?

The cops and judges will still get to use VPNs
because “ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD PEOPLE-RIGHT, RIGHT”?
I am an immigrant, and by definition, using a VPN,
I must be “a-hidin’ something” ‘specially in ideho
where COPS GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING!
