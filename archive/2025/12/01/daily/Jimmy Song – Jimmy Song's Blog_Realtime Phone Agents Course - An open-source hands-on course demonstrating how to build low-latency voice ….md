# Realtime Phone Agents Course

An open-source hands-on course demonstrating how to build low-latency voice agents using realtime streaming, vector search, and telephony integration.

Author:
Neural Maze

## Detailed Introduction

The “Realtime Phone Agents Course” is a community-maintained open-source hands-on course that demonstrates how to build low-latency voice agents for phone call scenarios. The course integrates realtime transport (e.g., FastRTC), vector search for semantic retrieval, Twilio for phone connectivity, and scalable GPU hosting to show an end-to-end flow from audio streaming to semantic decisioning and phone interaction. It focuses on engineering practices, deployment, and performance so teams can reproduce and deploy the solution.

## Main Features

* End-to-end practical examples covering audio streaming, retrieval, model inference, and telephony integration.
* Low-latency realtime transport choices to ensure conversational responsiveness.
* Demonstrates vector search for session memory and contextual retrieval.
* Deployment and scaling guidance, including using scalable GPU platforms.

## Use Cases

* Building phone-based customer service agents and voice assistants supporting live Q&A and task execution.
* Validating end-to-end feasibility and UX for low-latency voice interactions.
* Serving as internal training and reproducibility material for engineering teams to learn realtime voice agent stacks.

## Technical Features

* Combines RTC streaming and inference pipelines for low-latency responses.
* Uses vector retrieval for session context and memory to improve response relevance.
* Integrates with telephony platforms (e.g., Twilio) to demonstrate real call ingress and event handling.
* Engineering-focused deployment guidance with performance and cost trade-offs.
