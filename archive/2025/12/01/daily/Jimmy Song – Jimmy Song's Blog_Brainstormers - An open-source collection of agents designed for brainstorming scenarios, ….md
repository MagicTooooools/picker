## Detailed Introduction

Brainstormers is an open-source collection of agents tailored for brainstorming scenarios. Each agent implements a different prompting strategy or role to guide discussions, generate idea variants, or expand concepts, enabling teams to rapidly produce candidate solutions across multiple dimensions. The project provides an interactive demo (homepage) and reusable prompt templates for direct use in workshops, product design, or team brainstorming.

## Main Features

* Multi-agent strategies: role-based agents focusing on diverse creative perspectives.
* Reusable prompt templates to improve generation quality and consistency.
* Interactive demo accessible via the project homepage to try agents live.
* Open-source implementation for customization, extension, and integration.

## Use Cases

* Rapid idea generation during early-stage product design.
* Supporting divergence and convergence phases in creative workshops.
* Drafting marketing copy, campaign concepts, or content outlines for teams.

## Technical Features

* Prompt engineering and role-driven strategies to shape varied outputs.
* Support for integration with models and retrieval components to enhance factuality and context.
* Usability-focused with online examples and prompt templates for quick onboarding.
* Community-driven development to encourage continuous improvement and diverse agent contributions.
