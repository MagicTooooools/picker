# Workflow Builder Template

An open-source visual workflow template from Vercel Labs for building and automating AI workflows.

Author:
Vercel Labs

Since:
2025-11-03

## Detailed Introduction

The Workflow Builder Template from Vercel Labs is an open-source visual workflow template designed to help developers quickly build, visualize, and automate AI workflows. The template provides drag-and-drop nodes, input/output wiring, and common adapters to integrate model inference, data retrieval, and external services into reusable pipelines. It targets production-oriented delivery and is suitable for demonstrating and deploying workflows in real product scenarios.

## Main Features

* Visual editor and node-based design to lower the barrier for workflow construction.
* Built-in adapters for connecting models, vector search, and external APIs for quick integration.
* Template export and reuse to share best practices across teams.
* Designed for deployment and scaling with cloud execution and monitoring support.

## Use Cases

* Build visual RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) or inference pipelines so non-experts can participate in design.
* Rapid prototyping and internal tooling to connect models, data sources, and downstream services.
* Embed reusable automation tasks in products to improve delivery efficiency and reduce repeated work.

## Technical Features

* Node-based visual orchestration that decomposes complex logic into composable units.
* Adapters for model inference and vector databases to support end-to-end data flows.
* Focus on engineering and deployability, with guidance for monitoring and scaling in production.
* Open-source license and community support for customization and extension.
