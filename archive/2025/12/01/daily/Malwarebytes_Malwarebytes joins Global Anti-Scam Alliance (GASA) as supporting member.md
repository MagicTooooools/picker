# Malwarebytes joins Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) as supporting member

We are excited to share that Malwarebytes has officially joined the [Global Anti-Scam Alliance](https://www.gasa.org/) (GASA) as a supporting member. Working with GASA helps us stay aligned with others who are focused on reducing scams and keeping people safer online.

Modern-day scams aren’t the clumsy, obvious tricks they once were. They are sneakier, more direct, and harder to spot.

Earlier this year, when we surveyed more than 1,300 people across the world about their online habits for shopping, clicking, swiping, and sending messages, [we discovered a mobile landscape littered with scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile-scams):

* Nearly half of mobile users encounter scam attempts every day.
* Just 15% feel confident they can recognize one.
* More than a third have fallen victim, with 75% of victims saying they walked away with emotional harm and a shaken sense of trust.

One thing is certain—scams are no longer rare; they’re a daily reality for most people, and they are taking a toll.

As Mark Beare, general manager of consumer business for Malwarebytes, said:

> “Scams and consumer fraud aren’t fringe issues. They’ve become a global crisis, draining hundreds of billions of dollars each year and inflicting devastating emotional harm. We’re committed to tackling this complex problem through new technology like our AI-powered scam detector, [Scam Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/solutions/scam-guard), investigative research, industry collaboration, and perhaps most importantly, human support.”

This is exactly why we built [Scam Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/solutions/scam-guard), our free mobile scam detector: to give people real-time guidance, actionable tips, and simple scam reporting tools that make staying safe feel doable, not daunting. With Scam Guard, users can identify suspicious messages and links, instantly take action, and help others stay informed by reporting new scams as they appear.

Beare added:

> “Today’s scams are sophisticated, leveraging deep-fake technology, AI-manipulated images, and highly targeted lures from the troves of data we’ve all lost in countless breaches. We’re proud to join GASA to further amplify our efforts and stop scammers in their tracks.”

At Malwarebytes, protecting people is at the heart of what we do. By partnering with the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, we’re extending that protection to more communities around the world.
