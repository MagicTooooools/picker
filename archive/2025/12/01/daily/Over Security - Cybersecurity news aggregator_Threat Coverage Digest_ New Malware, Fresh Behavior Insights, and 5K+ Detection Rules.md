Threat Coverage Digest: New Malware Reports and 5K+ Detection Rules

November was a packed month for detection coverage. We rolled out new behavioral insights, broadened our visibility across multiple threat families, and strengthened rulesets at every layer. On top of that, our analysts uncovered and documented a new phishing wave targeting Italian organizations through malicious PDF attachments, now fully mapped in a dedicated TI report.

Let’s walk through the full set of improvements we delivered this month.

## Threat Intelligence Reports

In November, we published several [new TI Reports](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/11-25-italian-target-phishing) covering threats that are currently targeting companies around the world. The four of them are open to everyone:

* **[RoningLoader, HoldingHands, Snowlight](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/69280f8e6d50f714f87222a3):**APT-Q-27 loader chain, stealthy RAT, and Linux VShell dropper enabling cross-platform compromise of enterprise and server environments.

* **[PDFChampions, Efimer, BTMOB](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/11-20-threat-brief-pdfchampions-efimer-btmob):**Malvertising-based browser hijacker, Tor-hosted cryptocurrency stealer, and Android MaaS trojan abusing Accessibility to drain banking, fintech, and wallet applications.

* **[Monkey, Phoenix, NonEuclid](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/11-14-threat-brief-monkey-phoenix-noneuclid):**AI-generated Linux ransomware, espionage-focused backdoor, and dual-use RAT–ransomware illustrating convergence of state-aligned techniques and financially motivated crimeware.

* **[Valkyrie, Sfuzuan, Sorvepotel](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/11-05-threat-brief-valkyrie-sfuzuan-sorvepotel):**Windows stealer MaaS, adaptable backdoor, and WhatsApp-propagating campaign weaponizing social trust and messaging channels for large-scale infection.

We also wrote an [extensive report](https://intelligence.any.run/reports/11-25-italian-target-phishing) exclusively for the [TI Lookup Premium](https://intelligence.any.run/plans/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=Threat_Coverage_Digest_November_2025&utm_term=011225&utm_content=linktotiplans) subscribers. It goes in-depth on a phishing campaign aimed specifically at **Italian organizations across transportation, tourism, telecom, IT, and government sectors**. The activity relies on PDF attachments disguised as official documents, each redirecting victims to counterfeit Microsoft login pages built to harvest corporate credentials.

The report outlines:

* A consistent lure pattern using Italian-language prompts inviting recipients to “review” or “sign” a document

* PDF filenames following a shared template: **Allegato\_Ufficiale\_<variable>.pdf**

* Brand impersonation, including well-known Italian companies, to raise credibility

* Redirect chains leveraging both compromised domains and attacker-controlled infrastructure (e.g., **phebeschool.org**, **mircosotfonilne.ru**, **vorn.revolucionww.com**)

* Browser fingerprinting behavior tied to data collection on victim systems

* Email templates localized in Italian, with urgent subject lines pushing immediate action

We also included ready-to-use [**TI Lookup queries**](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=Threat_Coverage_Digest_November_2025&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) so analysts can surface related samples quickly, track the filename cluster, and follow the network infrastructure across recent public analysis sessions.
