## Detailed Introduction

Nano-PDF is a lightweight open-source command-line utility for everyday PDF processing, maintained by the community. It focuses on common PDF operations such as merging, splitting, compression, page rotation, and extracting images or text. Designed to be zero-configuration and small in footprint, it is convenient for CI pipelines, container images, and developer workflows.

## Main Features

* Lightweight with minimal dependencies for easy automation integration.
* Support for merging and splitting PDFs, single-page extraction, rotation, and reordering.
* Compression and optimization options to reduce file size for upload and archiving.
* Extraction of images and text from PDFs for downstream processing and indexing.

## Use Cases

* Automatically generate or merge document bundles in CI/CD pipelines for release.
* Batch optimize and compress scanned documents for long-term storage and transfer.
* Split documents into single pages for OCR, retrieval, or data extraction.
* Use as a lightweight PDF processing step in development scripts and automation.

## Technical Features

* CLI-first design for easy piping and scripting.
* Cross-platform compatibility, suitable for Unix-like environments and containers.
* Single-responsibility focus as a pragmatic utility rather than a full editor, reducing attack surface and dependency complexity.
* Open-source license and community maintenance to allow integration and customization.
