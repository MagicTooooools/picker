For customers who prefer to operate on stable branches, we have released an âR2â, or second release of the [Io, 5.2
release](https://binary.ninja/2025/11/13/binary-ninja-5.2-io.html). It includes multiple small stability improvements,
crash fixes, update fixes for Linux ARM builds, and fixes to WARP, DWARF, and Ghidra Import.

As always, customers with [active support](https://binary.ninja/purchase/) on the [development
branch](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/index.html#development-branch) have access to these changes and more.

## Core/Analysis

* **Fix**: Crash due to LLIL\_REG\_STACK\_FREE\_REL accessor mixup in SSA translator
* **Fix**: MLIL\_VAR vs MLIL\_VAR\_SSA check corrected
* **Fix**: Two load/store splitting bugs in MLIL where offsets were incorrectly calculated or defaulted to 0, causing incorrect field boundaries and wrong variable splitting ([#7647](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7647), [#7613](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7613))
* **Fix**: Race condition when adding sections during analysis that could cause crashes when loading DSC images ([#7681](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7681))
* **Fix**: Ensure updating flag cleared if exception thrown, preventing files from being stuck in âupdatingâ state

## Ghidra Import

* **Fix**: Not being able to create database from directly opened Ghidra project file
* **Fix**: Loading files with high IDs
* **Fix**: Loading of databases with no file contents, improve platform detection

## DWARF

* **Fix**: Prevent extra slashes in generated debuginfod urls
* **Fix**: Allow loading supplementary dwarf debug info from path in .gnu\_debugaltlink ([#7597](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7597))
* **Fix**: Crash in dwarf export with detached NTR vtable data variable ([#7646](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7646)

## WARP

* **Fix**: Stop propagating skipped file error when processing archives
* **Fix**: Leaking binary view on empty views ([#7674](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7674))
* **Fix**: Unused rerun matcher checkbox when loading file on disk
* **Fix**: Container list not refreshing for dynamically added containers
* **Fix**: Explicitly create user signature directory on plugin init
* **Fix**: âhas user annotationsâ flag not persisting when opening database ([#7269](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7269))

## UI/UX

* **Improvement**: Make project file picker columns resizable
* **Fix**: Tag type visibility changes not being reflected in the tag list ([#7662](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7662))
* **Fix**: Tag types not being loaded properly from snapshots
* **Fix**: File lock tooltip being spammed when selecting in flow graph ([#7644](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7644))
* **Fix**: Crash on Open with Options -> Upgrade Database -> Decline

## Enterprise/Remote

* **Fix**: âremote is not connectedâ log spam by adding connection checks before reading from remote
* **Fix**: Potential crash when switching remotes quickly after opening a file
* **Fix**: Downloading dependency files not downloading the right file

## Platform Support

* **Fix**: System CA inclusion in core download provider, fixing HTTPS downloads when system CA store contains proxy root CAs ([#7656](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7656))
* **Fix**: Restore linux aarch64 update functionality ([#7641](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/7641))
