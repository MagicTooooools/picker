# Astron RPA

An agent-ready RPA suite providing out-of-the-box automation tools and enterprise integration capabilities.

Author:

Since:
2025-09-20

## Detailed Introduction

Astron RPA is an agent-ready Robotic Process Automation (RPA) suite from iFlyTek for individuals and enterprises. It ships with reusable automation components, low-code/no-code integration, and deep adapters for collaboration with agent orchestration platforms. The project is designed for enterprise usability, supporting large-scale process automation, monitoring, governance, and integrations with external tools and LLMs.

## Main Features

* Out-of-the-box automation toolkit: UI automation, file processing, and workflow scheduling components.
* Agent-ready integrations: collaborate with agent platforms (e.g., Astron Agent) to extend RPA into agent orchestration scenarios.
* Low-code/no-code support: visual flow builders to lower integration barriers.
* Enterprise governance and monitoring: access control, auditing, and runtime observability for compliance.

## Use Cases

Suitable for cross-application automation in enterprise scenarios such as financial reconciliation, customer support automation, form processing, and cross-system data synchronization. For teams integrating RPA with LLMs/agents, Astron RPA provides an integration bridge to combine rule-based automation with intelligent decision-making.

## Technical Features

Astron RPA uses a modular architecture with adapter layers, a process engine, and a visual orchestration UI. It supports interfaces to external tools and LLMs (for example via MCP), emphasizes scalability, observability, and security for production deployments, and provides SDKs and runtime components for integration.
