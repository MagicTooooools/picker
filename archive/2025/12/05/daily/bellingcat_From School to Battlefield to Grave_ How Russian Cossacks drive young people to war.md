## How Russian Cossacks drive young people to war

This video was
[posted](https://t.me/infberkut/114)
in April 2024 by
**Беркут**, a student association within a
Russian Federal University.

Students, about to leave for an
[Airsoft
competition](https://vk.com/wall-184058020_522?z=video-184058020_456239030%2F81807678aa84db8f3f%2Fpl_post_-184058020_522),
stand in military formation
[outside
a campus building](https://yandex.com/maps/194/saratov/house/ulitsa_imeni_n_g_chernyshevskogo_104/YE8YdgZpT0cEQFtrfXlweHxnYA%3D%3D/?l=sat%2Cstv%2Csta&ll=46.020204%2C51.518652&panorama%5Bdirection%5D=155.031648%2C-16.635879&panorama%5Bfull%5D=true&panorama%5Bpoint%5D=46.019974%2C51.518466&panorama%5Bspan%5D=112.778973%2C56.455149&source=serp_navig&z=19).

This is
**Олег Монин**
who took Berkut’s oath
[four months earlier](https://vk.com/wall-102083337_1098). Through this veiled Cossack
Youth Organisation, he trained in combat tactics with returned fighters and transitioned from
pretend to real weapons.

Within a year, Oleg abandoned his studies and enlisted in
**БАРС-15**,
a Cossack Volunteer Battalion fighting in Ukraine.

By Feb. 10, 2025 Oleg was dead. He died aged 19, less than four months after deployment in Ukraine.

As of February 2025 there were more than 18,500 Cossacks
[on
the front lines](https://vsko.ru/vserossijskij-ataman-obyavil-o-sozdanii-26-go-kazachego-dobrovolcheskogo-podrazdeleniya/)
in Ukraine and approximately 50,000
[in the army
reserve](https://cepa.org/article/cossacks-at-war-ukrainian-russian-or-both/).

Cossack societies, organisations, and even military units provide an identity that is indigenous to
Russia, Visiting Assistant Professor at Miami University, Dr Marcello Fantoni told Bellingcat.

This
identity is “rooted in ‘traditional’ values, martial prowess, military readiness, orthodox
religiosity and a culture not influenced by the ‘corrupting’ West,” Fantoni added via email. This is
why “education is central to the overall enterprise”.

Oleg’s story demonstrates how the Cossacks drive young people from a school club to a war zone and
enable a state-sponsored alternative mobilisation force.

WHO ARE THE RUSSIAN COSSACKS?

The Cossacks played an important role in the formation of the Russian Empire. They lived in
communities called hosts on the edges of the empire. They operate under
[a military hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks#Ranks) ruled by a chief,
the **Ataman**. Due to their loyalty to the Tsar, the Cossacks were repressed by the
Bolsheviks after 1917.

When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Cossacks’ descendants
[called for a “rebirth”](https://youtu.be/TsgWX8atTIM).
In 2005, a bill submitted by President Vladimir Putin [allowed](https://www.rferl.org/a/1059023.html) registered Cossack organisations members
to serve in military units and police forces.

New hosts were created in traditionally non-Cossack lands with a
[variety of institutions](https://www.skvk.org/o-komitete/)
to direct them. In 2018, the government
[united them in the “All-Russian Cossack
Society”](https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-46362149). Putin tries to marginalise the traditional Cossack groups, analyst Paul Goble told
Bellingcat while the ones “he has created for his own purposes” play a “major role in military and
patriotic education”.

There are [13 registered Cossack Hosts](https://vsko.ru/reestrovye-kazachi-vojska/)
across all of Russia.

Only 8 of Russia’s 83 recognized
[Federal Subjects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_subjects_of_Russia) do not
have a registered Cossack Host.

In 2018, the Black Sea Cossack Host of Crimea
[entered
the register](https://vko-chkv.ru/%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B2%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4/).
The peninsula has been under Russian occupation since 2014. The Cossack legacy is also [vitally important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsgWX8atTIM) to Ukrainian
identity.

There are [new
hosts](https://jamestown.org/kremlin-continues-to-promote-cossack-rebirth-in-2025/) in the occupied Ukrainian territories of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and
Luhansk.

Russian Cossack organisations have been “very active within the occupied Ukrainian regions,” Dr
Fantoni told Bellingcat. They “recruit local residents and then deploy them for cultural and
military purposes,” allowing Russia “to contest and even co-opt a central tenet of Ukrainian
national identity – Cossackdom,” he said.

The national “All-Russian Cossack Society” *VSKO* was
[created
in 2018](https://vsko.ru/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ustav-vsko_redakcziya-dlya-pechati-itog.pdf),
and in 2019, the
State
Duma
gave Russian President Vladimir Putin exclusive authority to appoint its national Ataman.

Kuznetsov was
[appointed](http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202311220002)
in November 2023, succeeding the first-ever national Ataman – Nikolai Doluda, then 70 years old
and a
[sanctioned individual](https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/Q16645355/).

Kuznetsov has also become a leading Cossack interacting with the Russian state.
