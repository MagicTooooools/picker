## Detailed Introduction

Evalite is a TypeScript-first evaluation framework for applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It helps developers turn model and application checks into repeatable, automatable test suites and benchmarks. By treating evaluation as an engineering practice, Evalite makes it straightforward to integrate quality checks into development workflows and CI pipelines.

## Main Features

* TypeScript-first: write evaluation logic and assertions with static types for clearer, safer tests.
* Composable test units: build modular, reusable evaluation scenarios that evolve with your app.
* CI-friendly automation: run evaluations in CI and produce comparable benchmark reports.
* Multiple metrics: supports accuracy, robustness, consistency, and custom measurements.

## Use Cases

* Continuously validate model behaviour against business-critical scenarios during development.
* Compare different models or invocation strategies with reproducible benchmarks.
* Automate safety and behavior checks for sensitive scenarios before deployment.

## Technical Features

* Tight integration with the TypeScript/Node.js ecosystem for easy adoption in existing repositories.
* Extensible assertion and metrics interfaces to implement custom evaluation logic and report formats.
* Test-centric evaluation workflow designed for CI/CD integration.
* Open-source under the MIT license; project homepage and source code are available via the website and GitHub repository.
