The hypothetical scenario laid out by the book highlighted many of the fragilities that today's nuclear balance, based on the so-called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), has. The scenario started with North Korea launching a missile towards Washington, DC, an action no doubt very crazy but not completely unimaginable, considering that all nuclear countries, including those that are democratic in other aspects, are more or less dictatorial when it comes to the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore rely on the mental wellness of an individual ‒ sometimes a very old individual whose own future is very lacking. The US responded with dozens of its own nuclear weapons following the so-called "Launch on Warning" policy, which doesn't care about whether the enemy missile really carried a nuclear warhead (in the book, however, the author let North Korea launch a second missile, a short range one, that hit the US with a nuclear warhead, thus making the US response more rational than the policy allows). The US–North Korea nuclear exchange quickly escalated into an Armageddon due to three factors: 1. Some of the US missiles needed to fly over Russia; 2. The Russian missile detection system was not accurate enough to tell the difference between a fly over and an attack; 3. The presidential hotline between the US and Russia that was supposed to avoid such escalation was disrupted by the North Korea missile that hit Washington, DC. As a result, Russia, whose nuclear policy is no less reckless than "Launch on Warning", launched about 1,000 nuclear warheads towards US and NATO countries in Europe...... and the latter retaliated with whatever remained in their nuclear stockpile...... and that's pretty much the end of what used to be self-designated as the "Human Civilization".  September 10, 2025　　# Movie: Jaws  Watched the 50th anniversary re-release of the movie Jaws, and found it fairly enjoyable. I suppose it has been digitally enhanced to a certain degree to reduce the technological gap that should otherwise inevitably make it visually too far below today's standard. What I saw was a movie whose visual quality is not only good enough to watch, but in a sense "bad" enough so that some scenes were surprisingly (and perhaps inadvertently) coated with an artistic flavor, as if through an artistic or anime-style filter. I also enjoyed the scene in which Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange and compete with body-scar stories.  September 18, 2025　　# Book: In Joy Still Felt  Isaac Asimov is a favorite author of mine. I enjoy not only his writings but the chatty, rational, and humorous way he wrote. Several weeks ago, I saw in Strand a hardcover copy of the 2nd volume of his autobiography: In Joy Still Felt. I of course already have all his autobiographies. But the In Joy Still Felt I have is a paperback, different from the 1st volume In Memory Yet Green, which is a hardcover. Though tempted, I resisted the urge to buy it merely to make the two volumes look uniform, especially because the 2nd volume I have is already a re-purchase that substituted the copy I used to have, which was in poorer condition, and it felt guilty to spend yet more money on that volume. That book was in Strand ever since then, and became iteratively more attractive each time I visited Strand and saw it again, until I could resist no more and decided to buy it "next time". But when that time came, Murphy's Law, or a variant of it, kicked in, and the book was gone! [Notes: I had a similar experience [last year](202405.php#d0615).]  September 26, 2025　　# Movie: A Big Bold Beautiful Journey  Watched the movie A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. It is a hard-to-categorize movie in the sense that there is no way to make sense of the background setting: far too non-scientific to be a sci-fi, far too non-magical to be a fantasy, and far too unrealistic to be a normal movie. The plot was made up of a series of anecdotes, less coherent and logical than one would expect for a good movie, which I suppose it is not (for it was merely the 6th day since its release, and I was already the only one sitting in the auditorium). But with all the bizarreness, it is still a movie that is genuinely romantic with an atmosphere of suspense, and a movie worth watching.  October 1, 2025　　# Movie: Lawrence of Arabia  Watched the 2025 re-release of the 1962 movie Lawrence of Arabia. It is based on T. E. Lawrence's autobiographical book Seven Pillars of Wisdom. I heard of the book many years ago and was impressed by the intriguing history through which it came into being (i.e. the 1st draft of 250,000 words was lost, the 2nd draft of 400,000 words was self-ruled as "hopelessly bad" and abandoned, and the 3rd draft of about 250,000 words was finally published in a very small number of copies). I liked the movie (it was a long one with a 15-minute break in the middle), and I felt that perhaps because it was prior to the era of AI-assisted movie-making, more human creativity and talents could be seen sparkling, and it was elegant and artistic.  October 3, 2025　　# Movie: One Battle After Another  Watched the movie One Battle After Another. Not necessarily a bad movie, but not my type. It's basically "one battle after another" between far-left extremists and far-right extremists (with a major exception being a mere paranoid drug addict), both of whom rarely hesitate to kill not only enemies but whoever happens to get into their way. Curse words are so abundant that it's not too exaggerated to say nobody, whether a young girl or an old man, can speak a single sentence without them. Once again, not necessarily a bad movie, but not my type. There is not a single character I liked, not even marginally.  October 9, 2025　　# Asimov on Mystics  「Oddly enough, it is much easier to believe mystics than it is to believe scientists. Many a person who seriously questions the existence of atoms and who furiously doubts that the speed of light cannot be surpassed accepts UFOs without a murmur and is ready to believe that ghosts exist, that extrasensory perception is a known fact, and so on.」  —— Isaac Asimov Presents Tales of the Occult  October 14, 2025　　# Autumn  The footsteps of autumn...   ![](images/fall2025.jpg)  October 15, 2025　　# Threads Is Very Dead  Although I'm still posting on Threads, the platform seems very dead to me, and perhaps to others with small accounts similar to mine.
