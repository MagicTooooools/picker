## Detailed Introduction

KrillinAI is a video translation and dubbing tool that combines large language models (LLMs), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text-to-speech (TTS) to provide bi-directional translation and natural dubbing across 100 languages. It offers one-click end-to-end deployment and produces outputs optimized for platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Bilibili, enabling creators to localize video content at scale while preserving viewing experience.

## Main Features

* 100-language bi-directional translation and subtitle generation.
* Integrated ASR+translation+TTS pipeline for automated transcription, timing, and dubbing.
* Platform-aware outputs optimized for short-form and long-form video timelines and formats.
* One-click deployment for integrating into CI/CD pipelines.

## Use Cases

* Content creators localize videos quickly for multi-language distribution.
* Media companies bulk-generate multilingual subtitles and dubbing to expand reach.
* Educational and corporate training video localization and distribution.

## Technical Features

* Service architecture implemented in Go, compatible with containerized deployments and common toolchains.
* Hybrid LLM+ASR+TTS pipeline with extensible model and parameter hooks for quality tuning.
* Open-source under GPL-3.0; source code and project homepage are provided in the frontmatter.
