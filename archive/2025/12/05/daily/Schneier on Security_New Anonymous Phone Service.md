@ Bruce, All,

First off I’m not saying that this is a bad idea, but that that there are “gottchers” with all such systems that people need to be not just aware of, but know how to mitigate to an acceptable level.

So… With regards to,

> “… allows you to sign up with just a zip code.”

Thus the question,

“Just how anonymous is a zip code?”

The answer is unsurprisingly “not very”. It was something Prof Ross Anderson spent some time considering with the UK equivalent of “Post Codes”.

In both cases of zip and post codes they are set up as a convenience for a service provider and to act as a form of “checksum” on an address.

Like Social Security numbers they get used by others for purposes that they were not originally intended for thus they suffer from “organic growth” and the consequences of that equivalent to,

“A weed infested flower bed in a seriously over grown garden.”

From personal experience I know of a UK post code that only had one occupied property in it. Due in the main to turning the rest of it into a “brownfield site” by bulldozer,

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land>

Thus it falls to just how anonymous is the “official occupier” of the property?

The same sort of thing applies to all such “tagging and checksumming” schemes that “hash”. They don’t actually offer anonymity they are generally not “One Way Functions” so give just complication and complexity to reverse back thus de-anonymize. As we should know that is what “Rainbow Tables” were invented for,

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table>

Then if you move in and move out of a post / zip code the complicated question of “wire fraud” and “postal fraud” arises.

There are quite a number of other gotchers in both the US and UK that I’m aware of that would apply to similar schemes and very new legislation in the UK only makes this worse a lot worse,

The UK Public Authorities “Fraud, Error and Recovery”(FEAR) Act 2025 officially stated purpose is to enhance the government’s ability to tackle fraud and recover debts owed to the taxpayer, etc.

What should scare people is the “etc” that makes it a very nasty set of Privacy Invading and Surveillance legislation handed out to those with vested interests to claim faux debt etc, and criminalise without evidence.

Such legislation is becoming more and more popular as things turn increasingly authoritarian, and many countries world wide are putting similar legislation and regulation into place, that effects all levels of communications that people are increasingly forced to use in a “collected way”.

For instance “Online Finance” it’s got to the point where the only way you can communicate with your bank is via a fully registered “Smart Phone”, app, and Email, all of which are basically a backdoor access into your private life.

“ZIP+4 Code must be in the format 12345-6789”

Is not anonymous at all.

AFAICT there are exactly zero measures taken to validate the ZIP+4.

Since it is the only piece of identifiable information collected, there is of course no way to confirm or deny it’s accuracy.

One could therefore choose to enter *any* ZIP+4 when they open an account, but Phreeli is obviously not going to advertise this fact.

The bigger problem is as an MVNO, the parent network is going to have all the location data from the cell network. So, you better not have the phone on at home…

One has to ask whether a purportedly private service has been or will be acquired by an organization that will override past policy.

Or it could even be trojan cell carrier, that’s happened before.
We are in charge of our own privacy.

Ceding my privacy to someone else is the first step away from my privacy.

**Phreeli’s privacy policy:**

<https://www.phreeli.com/privacy/policy>

Here’s more that Phreeli collects: your Phreeli-issued phone number, call detail records, device/subscriber identifiers, etc.

The policy has more about how they use and share this info. Eg, they may share it ‘*to protect us or others*‘ and they may share it with affiliates and related businesses, etc …

@Clive Robinson

`"What should scare people is the “etc” that makes it a very nasty set of Privacy Invading and Surveillance legislation handed out to those with vested interests to claim faux debt etc, and criminalise without evidence."`

Honestly, in the age of computers, “etc” is like a USB drive with no label—you know there’s something on it, but the system can’t read it. Computers don’t do “etc”; they need the entire list, or they just throw an error and sulk. Imagine trying to feed “etc” into an AI—it would spin forever, wondering if you meant more spyware, a free trial of antivirus software, or a pop-up ad for medieval chainmail. Without specifics, “etc” is just digital nonsense, like asking Google Maps to take you to “Etc Street.”

On “etc”
Clive might be referring to things like structuring, where what structing is exactly, is just made up, and essentially innocent people can be forced into plea bargins because some government official decided to pick on them.
