# Leaks show Intellexa burning zero-days to keep Predator spyware running

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 5, 2025

![Intellexa Predator](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/peeping_predator.png?w=1200)

Intellexa is a well-known commercial spyware vendor, servicing governments and large corporations. Its main product is the Predator spyware.

An [investigation](https://www.inside-it.ch/intellexa-leaks-beruechtigte-spionagefirma-weiterhin-aktiv-20251203) by several independent parties describes Intellexa as one of the most notorious mercenary spyware vendors, still operating its Predator platform and hitting new targets even after being placed on US sanctions lists and being under active investigation in Greece.

The investigation draws on highly sensitive documents and other materials leaked from the company, including internal records, sales and marketing material, and training videos. [Amnesty International researchers](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2025/12/intellexa-leaks-predator-spyware-operations-exposed/) reviewed the material to verify the evidence.

To me, the most interesting part is Intellexa’s continuous use of zero-days against mobile browsers. [Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/intellexa-zero-day-exploits-continue) posted a blog about that, including a list of 15 unique zero-days.

Intellexa can afford to buy and burn zero-day vulnerabilities. They buy them from hackers and use them until the bugs are discovered and patched–at which point they are “burned” because they no longer work against updated systems.

The price for such vulnerabilities depends on the targeted device or application and the impact of exploitation. For example, you can expect to pay in the range of $100,000 to $300,000 for a robust, weaponized Remote Code Excecution (RCE) exploit against Chrome with sandbox bypass suitable for reliable, at‑scale deployment in a mercenary spyware platform. And in 2019, zero-day exploit broker Zerodium [offered millions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2019/09/04/why-zerodium-will-pay-2-5-million-for-anyone-who-can-hack-android-but-only-2-million-for-an-iphone/) for zero-click full chain exploits with persistence against Android and iPhones.

Which is why only governments and well-resourced organizations can afford to hire Intellexa to spy on the people they’re interested in.

The Google TAG blog states:

> “Partnering with our colleagues at CitizenLab in 2023, we captured a full iOS zero-day exploit chain used in the wild against targets in Egypt. Developed by Intellexa, this exploit chain was used to install spyware publicly known as Predator surreptitiously onto a device.”

To slow down the “burn” rate of its exploits, Intellexa delivers one-time links directly to targets through end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is a common method: last year we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/pegasus-spyware-creator-ordered-to-reveal-code-used-to-spy-on-whatsapp-users) how the NSO Group was ordered to hand over the code for Pegasus and other spyware products that were used to spy on WhatsApp users.

The fewer people who see an exploit link, the harder it is for researchers to capture and analyze it. Intellexa also uses malicious ads on third-party platforms to fingerprint visitors and redirect those who match its target profiles to its exploit delivery servers.
