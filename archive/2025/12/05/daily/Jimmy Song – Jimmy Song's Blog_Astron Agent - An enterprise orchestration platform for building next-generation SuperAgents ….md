# Astron Agent

An enterprise orchestration platform for building next-generation SuperAgents with agent workflows and low-code integration.

Author:
iFlyTek

Since:
2025-09-19

## Detailed Introduction

Astron Agent is an open-source, enterprise-grade agentic workflow platform by iFlyTek designed to enable next-generation SuperAgents. The project offers orchestration for multi-agent collaboration, low-code integration pathways, and enterprise governance features. It provides runtime components, SDKs, and developer tools to accelerate building, deploying, and operating complex automated workflows in production environments.

## Main Features

* Orchestrated multi-agent workflows: define, schedule, and monitor coordinated agent tasks.
* Enterprise integrations: low-code connectors, access control, and governance hooks.
* Robust runtime: fault tolerance, observability, and scalable deployment options.
* Open-source license: Apache-2.0 licensed code suitable for enterprise evaluation and integration.

## Use Cases

Suitable for enterprise automation scenarios requiring cross-system coordination and complex process automation, such as automated customer support, knowledge-driven business workflows, automated operations, and multi-step data pipelines. The platform is also a fit for building SuperAgent applications that require task distribution, compensation, and rollback mechanisms.

## Technical Features

Astron Agent adopts a modular architecture comprising an orchestration engine, plugin adapter layer, and runtime monitoring components, and supports integrations with LLMs and external tools via protocols like MCP. The system prioritizes extensibility and pluggability, offering SDKs and low-code interfaces to shorten the path from prototype to production.
