Since the Online Safety Act took effect in late July, UK internet users have made it very clear to their politicians that they do not want anything to do with this censorship regime. Just days after age checks came into effect, VPN apps became the [most downloaded](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn72ydj70g5o) on Apple's App Store in the UK, and a [petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/722903) calling for the repeal of the Online Safety Act (OSA) hit over 400,000 signatures.

In the months since, more than 550,000 people have petitioned Parliament to repeal or reform the Online Safety Act, making it one of the largest public expressions of concern about a UK digital law in recent history.
