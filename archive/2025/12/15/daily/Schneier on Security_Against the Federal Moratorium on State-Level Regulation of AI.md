## Against the Federal Moratorium on State-Level Regulation of AI

Cast your mind back to May of this year: Congress was in the throes of debate over the massive [budget bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1). Amidst the many seismic provisions, Senator Ted Cruz [dropped](https://iapp.org/news/a/policy-analysis-us-house-committee-seeks-moratorium-on-state-AI-rules) a ticking time bomb of tech policy: a ten-year moratorium on the ability of states to regulate artificial intelligence. To many, this was catastrophic. The few massive AI companies seem to be swallowing our economy whole: their energy demands are overriding household needs, their data demands are overriding creators’ copyright, and their products are triggering mass unemployment as well as new types of clinical [psychoses](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/urban-survival/202507/the-emerging-problem-of-ai-psychosis). In a moment where Congress is seemingly unable to act to pass any meaningful consumer protections or market regulations, why would we hamstring the one entity evidently capable of doing so—the states? States that have already enacted consumer protections and other AI regulations, like [California](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/05/state-ai-regulation-ban/), and those actively debating them, like [Massachusetts](https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/mass-must-resist-congresss-proposed-moratorium-on-state-ai-regulation/), were alarmed. Seventeen Republican governors wrote a [letter](https://www.rga.org/republican-governors-praise-one-big-beautiful-bill-urge-congress-allow-states-protect-citizens-misuse-artificial-intelligence/) decrying the idea, and it was ultimately killed in a rare [vote](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00363.htm) of bipartisan near-unanimity.

The idea is back. Before Thanksgiving, a House Republican leader [suggested](https://www.techpolicy.press/its-back-congress-gears-up-for-yearend-fight-over-moratorium-on-ai-laws/) they might slip it into the annual defense spending bill. Then, a draft document [leaked](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/19/white-house-prepares-executive-order-to-block-state-ai-laws-00660719) outlining the Trump administration’s intent to enforce the state regulatory ban through executive powers. An outpouring of opposition (including from some [Republican](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/republicans-once-again-thwart-trumps-push-to-block-state-ai-laws/) state leaders) beat back that notion for a few weeks, but on Monday, Trump [posted](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/trump-says-ai-executive-order-limiting-state-rules-coming-this-week-00680557) on social media that the promised Executive Order is indeed coming soon. That would put a growing [cohort](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-ai-governance-legislation-tracker/) of states, including California and New York, as well as Republican strongholds like Utah and Texas, in jeopardy.

The constellation of motivations behind this proposal is clear: conservative ideology, cash, and China.

The [intellectual](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/1-000-ai-bills--time-for-congress-to-get-serious-about-preemption) argument in favor of the moratorium is that “[freedom](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/9/sen-cruz-ai-policy-should-harness-the-power-of-american-ingenuity)“-killing state regulation on AI would create a patchwork that would be difficult for AI companies to comply with, which would slow the pace of innovation needed to win an [AI arms race](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/opinion/ai-safety-ethics-effective.html) with China. AI companies and their investors have been aggressively peddling this narrative for years now, and are increasingly backing it with [exorbitant](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/ai-industry-pours-millions-into-politics) lobbying dollars. It’s a handy argument, useful not only to kill regulatory constraints, but also—companies hope—to win federal [bailouts](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/if-you-thought-the-2008-bank-bailout) and [energy](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/28/openai_100gw_power_demand/) subsidies.

Citizens should parse that argument from their own point of view, not Big Tech’s. Preventing states from regulating AI means that those companies get to tell Washington what they want, but your state representatives are powerless to represent your own interests. Which freedom is more important to you: the freedom for a few near-monopolies to profit from AI, or the freedom for you and your neighbors to demand protections from its abuses?

There is an element of this that is more partisan than ideological. Vice President J.D. Vance [argued](https://reason.org/commentary/next-steps-senate-rejected-ai-regulation-moratorium/) that federal preemption is needed to prevent “progressive” states from controlling AI’s future. This is an indicator of creeping polarization, where Democrats decry the monopolism, bias, and harms attendant to corporate AI and Republicans reflexively take the opposite side. It doesn’t help that some in the parties also have direct [financial interests](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/us/politics/howard-lutnick-family-ai.html) in the AI supply chain.

But this does not need to be a partisan wedge issue: both Democrats and Republicans have strong reasons to support state-level AI legislation. Everyone shares an interest in protecting consumers from harm created by Big Tech companies. In leading the charge to kill Cruz’s initial AI moratorium proposal, Republican Senator Masha Blackburn [explained](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/30/congress/blackburn-yanks-support-for-ai-moratorium-00434635) that “This provision could allow Big Tech to continue to exploit kids, creators, and conservatives? we can’t block states from making laws that protect their citizens.” More recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wants to [regulate AI](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/11/florida-ai-desantis-trump-00661793) in his state.

The often-heard complaint that it is hard to comply with a patchwork of state regulations rings hollow. Pretty much every other consumer-facing industry has managed to deal with local regulation—automobiles, children’s toys, food, and drugs—and those regulations have been effective consumer protections. The AI industry includes some of the most valuable companies globally and has demonstrated the ability to comply with differing regulations around the world, including the EU’s [AI](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) and [data privacy](https://gdpr-info.eu/) regulations, substantially more onerous than those so far adopted by US states. If we can’t leverage state regulatory power to shape the AI industry, to what industry could it possibly apply?

The regulatory superpower that states have here...
