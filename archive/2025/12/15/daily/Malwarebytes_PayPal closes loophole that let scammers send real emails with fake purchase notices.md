# PayPal closes loophole that let scammers send real emails with fake purchase notices

![PayPal tech support scam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/paypal-tech-support-scam.jpg?w=1200)

After an investigation by [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-paypal-subscriptions-abused-to-send-fake-purchase-emails/), PayPal closed a loophole that allowed scammers to send emails from the legitimate `service@paypal.com` email address.

Following reports from people who received emails claiming an automatic payment had been cancelled, BleepingComputer found that cybercriminals were abusing a PayPal feature that allows merchants to pause a customer’s subscription.

The scammers created a PayPal subscription and then paused it, which triggers PayPal’s genuine “Your automatic payment is no longer active” notification to the subscriber. They also set up a fake subscriber account, likely a Google Workspace mailing list, which automatically forwards any email it receives to all other group members.

This allowed the criminals to use a similar method to one we’ve described [before](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/fake-paypal-invoice-from-geek-squad-is-a-tech-support-scam), but this time with the legitimate `service@paypal.com` address as the sender, bypassing email filters and a first casual check by the recipient.

> “Your automatic payment is no longer active

> You’ll need to contact Sony U.S.A. for more details or to reactivate your automatic payments. Here are the details:”

BleepingComputer says there are slight variations in formating and phone numbers to call, but in essence they are all based on this method.

To create urgency, the scammers made the emails look as though the target had been charged for some high-end, expensive device. They also added a fake “PayPal Support” phone number, encouraging targets to call in case if they wanted to cancel the payment of had questions

In this type of [tech support scam,](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/05/how-to-spot-and-avoid-a-tech-support-scam) the target calls the listed number, and the “support agent” on the other end asks to remotely log in to their computer to check for supposed viruses. They might run a short program to open command prompts and folders, just to scare and distract the victim. Then they’ll ask to install another tool to “fix” things, which will search the computer for anything they can turn into money. Others will sell you fake protection software and bill you for their services. Either way, the result is the same: the victim loses money.

PayPal contacted BleepingComputer to let them know they were closing the loophole:

> “We are actively mitigating this matter, and encourage people to always be vigilant online and mindful of unexpected messages. If customers suspect they are a target of a scam, we recommend they contact Customer Support directly through the PayPal app or our Contact page for assistance.”

## How to stay safe

The best way to stay safe is to stay informed about the tricks scammers use. Learn to spot the red flags that almost always give away scams and phishing emails, and remember:

* **Use verified, official ways to contact companies.** Don’t call numbers listed in suspicious emails or attachments.
* **Beware of someo...
