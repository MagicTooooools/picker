# Predictions 2026: Surge in Agentic AI for Attacks and Defenses

Over the years, cybersecurity predictions tend to all sound the same. Ransomware attacks will continue, supply-chain incidents will increase, and phishing will remain a problem.

However, the tail end of 2025 and 2026 presented the cybersecurity industry with a new concern, Agentic AI.

Agentic AI capabilities far exceed the basic AI concerns that were reported in the past. Its ability to make decisions and take actions on its own, without needing a human to approve every step, is a game-changer. When this is tied to its ability to achieve a complex, overarching objective (such as a cyberattack) rather than just completing a single, prompted task, it potentially becomes a huge headache for security teams.

### Agentic AI on the Scene

“We are seeing the first big splash of Autonomous AI agents (systems that can independently plan, execute, and adapt cyberattacks or defensive measures) that will become more mainstream,” said Scott Swanson, Practice Leader, Security Advisory, for Stroz Friedberg, A LevelBlue Company, which will accelerate the speed and scale of potential threats.

In 2026, Ed Williams, Vice President, Spiderlabs, CPS, expects the march of AI to continue, embedding itself even deeper into every layer of the stack. This will include agentic agents that manage cloud resources to real-time phishing engines crafting perfect emails.

“This new paradigm will turn AI into the next attack surface multiplier, where a single compromised model or poisoned dataset could trigger cascading breaches far beyond what traditional malware can achieve today,” he noted.
