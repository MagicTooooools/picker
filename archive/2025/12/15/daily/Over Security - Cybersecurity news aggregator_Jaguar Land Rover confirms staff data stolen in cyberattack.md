# Jaguar Land Rover confirms staff data stolen in cyberattack

British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed data belonging to current and former employees was compromised in a cyberattack that struck in August.

The announcement is the first time the company has provided any details about the attack, which halted production for more than a month, ultimately leaving JLR short of [more than $890 million](https://therecord.media/jaguar-land-rover-quarterly-loss-cyberattack).

Although the nature of the attack itself has still not been confirmed, a JLR spokesperson said the ongoing forensic investigation revealed “that certain data related to current and former JLR employees, and contractors, was affected by the cyber incident.”

“We remain in dialogue with the relevant regulators and we are in the process of contacting current and former employees and contractors as necessary,” the spokesperson added.

“We are committed to supporting all current and former employees, and contractors, through this period and we have set up a help line and arranged for access to credit and/or identity monitoring services. We are very sorry that the incident happened and would like to thank everyone connected with JLR for their continued support.”

As [reported](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/12/13/jaguar-land-rover-employees-pay-data-stolen-in-cyber-attack/) by The Telegraph, JLR emailed current and former employees to explain the affected data was held “in the context of employment and some information needed to administer payroll, benefits and staff schemes to employees and dependents.”

The company told its current and former staff there was no evidence the data had been misused, but cautioned them to be wary of phishing emails attempting to exploit access to the confidential information.

The impact on JLR, one of the British economy’s largest manufacturers, extended to a large number of other companies in its supply chain. One senior British politician [called](https://therecord.media/jlr-cyber-shockwave-auto-sector) it “a cyber shockwave ripping through our industrial heartlands,” with potentially thousands of jobs put at risk. The British government ultimately intervened to [secure a loan](https://therecord.media/jaguar-land-rover-loan-guarantor-cyberattack) JLR said would be used to help support those suppliers.

A monitoring group [estimated](https://therecord.media/jaguar-land-rover-cyberattack-economic-impact) the shutdown would cost the British economy £1.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in total, with impacts felt across more than 5,000 other organizations from JLR’s own multi-tier manufacturing supply chain through to downstream entities such as dealerships.
