*Content warning: This article contains descriptions of non-consensual sexual imagery.*

Depending on which of his social media profiles you were looking at, Mark Resan was either a marketing lead at Google or working for a dental implant company, a human resources company and a business software firm – all at the same time.

But a Bellingcat investigation has found that the Hungarian national is the key figure behind, and the likely owner of, at least two deepfake porn websites – RefacePorn and DeepfakePorn – that until recently were selling paid subscriptions.

There is no question about the nature of these websites. RefacePorn’s landing page shows an explicit video of a woman performing a sexual act. As the video plays, her face is replaced with a variety of other women’s faces. The text above declares: “Face swap deepfake porn. Upload your face!”

[Deepfake porn sites](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/02/23/behind-a-secretive-global-network-of-non-consensual-deepfake-pornography/) such as these, which use artificial intelligence to create sexually explicit images and videos – usually without the consent of those whose faces or bodies are featured – have proliferated at an alarming rate in recent years. The impact on victims has been described as “[life-shattering](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-65854112)”, with the mental health effects similar to [those reported by victims of sexual assault](https://endcyberabuse.org/law-intro/#:~:text=In%20this%20sense%2C%20the%20mental,reaching%20personal%20and%20professional%20consequences).

While the technology to make these synthetic images is not new, the rise of mainstream AI image generator tools and [“Nudify” apps](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2025/06/18/meta-crushai-crushmate-deepfake-nudify-apps/) has [made it more widely available](https://www.techpolicy.press/ai-experts-officials-and-survivors-talk-policy-solutions-in-first-ever-global-summit-on-deepfake-abuse/) to people without deep technical expertise. Earlier this year, New Zealand MP Laura McClure [held up an AI-generated nude of herself](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/internet/terrifying-moment-mp-showed-deepfake-nude-pic-of-herself-in-parliament/news-story/a5badae8c373811762934db24a765695) in parliament, describing how it took her less than five minutes to create after a quick Google search.

A 2024 [study](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGLHpt6WlY/Hfztqtw_-tKza_2l1cPNrA/view?utm_content=DAGLHpt6WlY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor#1) by the My Image My Choice campaign found that there was a 1,780 percent increase in sexually explicit deepfakes last year compared to 2019. Almost all (99 percent) of victims were women, according to a [2023 study](https://www.securityhero.io/state-of-deepfakes/) by Security Hero.

The creation of such images and videos is now illegal in a few countries, including the [US](https://www.k12dive.com/news/congress-passes-take-it-down-act-criminalizes-deepfakes/746648/) and the [UK](https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/government-criminalises-creation-of-deepfakes-but-with-a-major-loophole/), but legislation has not caught up in many others, and the owners of platforms that enable this content often face no repercussions. In May 2024, the EU passed a [directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1385/oj/eng) which mandates that member states – including Hungary, where Resan resides – criminalise the creation and distribution of non-consensual sexual deepfakes by June 2027.

Alexios Mantzarlis, co-founder of Indicator, a news site that [focuses on digital deception](https://indicator.media/about), said his publication estimates that deepfake porn sites likely make millions of dollars a year.

“The incentive system will continue to exist until the tools become too toxic to handle for domain hosts and content delivery networks,” added Mantzarlis, who is also the director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech.

## All Roads Lead to Resan

Bellingcat’s investigation into RefacePorn and DeepfakePorn – which spanned corporate registries, domain name registrations, payment redirect sites, website code and leaked data – led us back to Resan.

By simulating the purchase of subscriptions on these websites, Bellingcat was led through a series of redirects to a payments dashboard by Peerwallet, a payment processor that recorded more than US$331,000 in sales from July 2024 to August 2025 by Dorocron LLP. Dorocron is a Canadian-registered company whose main – if not sole – source of income appeared to be from paid subscriptions to these sites. The real amount is likely higher, as this was just one of several payment processors the websites have used.

Dorocron LLP did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email, and calls to the number listed on sites that had the company’s details in their legal information sections went unanswered.

Resan is the only person who appears to have been publicly associated with Dorocron LLP, and he is also the sole director of a UK-registered company, Facitic Ltd, that registered the domain of RefacePorn. Resan did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent via email over the past two weeks. Multiple emails and phone calls to Facitic Ltd also went unanswered.

However, days after we first reached out to Resan, his LinkedIn and X profiles were deleted, and his previously public Facebook profile was either deleted or made private. Both RefacePorn and DeepfakePorn also became inaccessible, displaying an error message that said “this site can’t be reached”.

Archives of RefacePorn and DeepfakePorn, which were previously available on the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/01/09/using-the-wayback-machine-and-google-analytics-to-uncover-disinformation-networks/), have also now been excluded from the archive.
