If you use a smartphone, browse the web, or unzip files on your computer, you are in the crosshairs this week. Hackers are currently exploiting critical flaws in the daily software we all rely on—and in some cases, they started attacking before a fix was even ready.

Below, we list the urgent updates you need to install right now to stop these active threats.

## **⚡ Threat of the Week**

**[Apple and Google Release Fixes for Actively Exploited Flaws](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/apple-issues-security-updates-after-two.html)** — Apple released security updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and Safari web browser to address two zero-days that the company said have been exploited in highly targeted attacks. CVE-2025-14174 has been described as a memory corruption issue, while the second, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free bug. They can both be exploited using maliciously crafted web content to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2025-14174 was also [addressed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/chrome-targeted-by-active-in-wild.html) by Google in its Chrome browser since it resides in its open-source Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE) library. There are currently no details on how these flaws were exploited, but evidence points to it likely having been weaponized by commercial spyware vendors.

## The CISO Org Chart Playbook

This playbook is for security leaders who are scaling CloudSec teams and need a structure that keeps up with cloud complexity. Built specifically for modern cloud-forward security teams, it breaks down how CISOs are structuring cloud security functions today – including emerging roles, team models, reporting lines, and practical templates for planning headcount and responsibilities across cloud, AppSec, platform security, and more.](https://thehackernews.uk/wiz-ciso-template-ar)

## **🔔 Top News**

* **[SOAPwn Exploits HTTP Client Proxies in .NET for RCE](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/net-soapwn-flaw-opens-door-for-file.html)** — Cybersecurity researchers uncovered an unexpected behavior of HTTP client proxies in .NET applications, potentially allowing attackers to achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability has been codenamed SOAPwn. At its core, the problem has to do with how .NET applications might be vulnerable to arbitrary file writes because .NET's HTTP client proxies also accept non-HTTP URLs such as files, a behavior that Microsoft says developers are responsible for guarding against — but not likely to expect. This, in turn, can open remote code execution (RCE) attack paths through web shells and malicious PowerShell scripts in many .NET applications, including commercial products. By being able to pass an arbitrary URL to a SOAP API endpoint in an affected .NET application, an attacker can trigger a leak of NTLM challenge. The issue can also be exploited through Web Services Description Language (WSDL) imports, which can then be used to generate client SOAP proxies that can be controlled by the attacker. "The .NET Framework allows its HTTP client proxies to be tricked into interacting with the filesystem. With the right conditions, they will happily write SOAP requests into local paths instead of sending them over HTTP," watchTowr said. "In the best case, this results in NTLM relaying or challenge capture. In the worst case, it becomes remote code execution through webshell uploads or PowerShell script drops."
* **[Attackers Exploit New Flaw in CentreStack and Triofox](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/hard-coded-gladinet-keys-let-attackers.html)** — A new vulnerability in Gladinet's CentreStack and Triofox products is being actively exploited by unknown threat actors to achieve code execution. The vulnerability, which does not have a CVE identifier, can be abused to access the web.config file, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code. At the core of the issue is a design failure in how they generate the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the access tokens the products use to control who can retrieve what files. As a result, the cryptographic keys never change and can be used to access files containing valuable data. Huntress said, as of December 10, 2025, nine organizations have been affected by the newly disclosed flaw.
* **[WinRAR Flaw Exploited by Multiple Threat Actors](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/warning-winrar-vulnerability-cve-2025.html)** — A high-severity flaw in WinRAR (CVE-2025-6218, CVSS score: 7.8) has come under active exploitation, fueled by three different threat actors tracked as GOFFEE (aka Paper Werewolf), Bitter (aka APT-C-08 or Manlinghua), and Gamaredon. CVE-2025-6218 is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute code in the context of the current user. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the necessary fixes by December 30, 2025.
* **[Exploitation of React2Shell Surges](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/react2shell-exploitation-escalates-into.html)** — The recently disclosed maximum-severity security flaw in React (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) has come under widespread exploitation, with threat actors targeting unpatched systems to deliver various kinds of malware.
