## Urban VPN Proxy Surreptitiously Intercepts AI Chats

This is [pretty scary](https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection):

> Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), Meta AI.
>
> For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated “executor” script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension’s configuration.
>
> There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.
>
> […]
>
> The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background.
>
> […]
>
> What gets captured:
>
> * Every prompt you send to the AI

But I really really really have no life outside of this blog.
And I must try very hard to prove to everyone in the world that I am a very very very very intelligent fella because it makes me feel all fuzzy and warm,
otherwise – my entire life would make no sense at all. Dammit man, I am the smartest human and who cares about my leaky diapers, right?
I must impress everyone, you better believe it, I am the shit, right?

You go Clive – you are the smartest, the bestest, the hottest….
Forget about the diaper change, I bet it’s nice and warm and mushy for at least a half an hour until the poo cools off. Might as well enjoy the warm and soft and fuzzy…..
My God you are so smart Clive, my God my god my gosh…your IQ must be in the 1000s..
I love you man – you are brilliant!!!!!!!
I love you man. – Susan.

Those VPNs (especially the free ones) are spilling the tea. As the researchers show, this ‘tool’ and its surveillance family are using an aggressive technique so that the extension sees the raw API traffic, including all the AI conversation data. As noted above, even if the extension itself is disabled.

The information market is mind-boggling.
