Contact: malvuln13@gmail.com
Media: x.com/malvuln
Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Poison.jh
Vulnerability: Insecure Permissions
Description: The malware creates the directory 28463 under C:\Windows\SysWOW64, granting Full (F) permissions to the Everyone user group. This allows any local user to modify or replace any dropped files, enabling trivial malware disruption or execution hijacking. This reflects poor operational security exposing malware components to local tampering.
Family: Poison
Type: PE32
Attack-pattern TTP: File and Directory Permissions Modification (T1222.001)
MD5: 3d9821cbe836572410b3c5485a7f76ca
SHA256: 2229d26afafb4b7fe1eaaa92ce1251c00eda9bac3f1371c470e7bbd5ae0a5bf9
Vuln ID: MVID-2025-0704
Dropped files: YJBE.exe
Disclosure: 12/23/2025
Exploit/PoC:
C:\>cacls C:\Windows\SysWOW64\28463\YJBE.exe
C:\Windows\SysWOW64\28463\YJBE.exe Everyone:(ID)F
