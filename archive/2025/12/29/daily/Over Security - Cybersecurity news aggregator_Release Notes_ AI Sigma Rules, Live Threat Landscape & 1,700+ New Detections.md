Release Notes: AI Sigma Rules, Live Threat Landscape & 1,700+ New Detections

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_25&utm_term=060126&utm_content=linktolanding) is wrapping up 2025 with updates that take pressure off your SOC and help your team work faster. You can now get [AI‑generated Sigma](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ai-sigma-rules/) rules, track threats by [industry and region](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/industry-geo-threat-landscape/), and detect new campaigns with better speed and accuracy.

Let’s see what these improvements bring to your security stack.

## Product Updates

### Industry & Geo Threat Landscape in TI Lookup

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-12.png)

[TI Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_25&utm_term=060126&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) now gives every indicator extra context showing which [**industries** and **countries**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/industry-geo-threat-landscape/) are linked to the threat of your industry and where similar activity is trending. It’s an easy way to see whether a threat actually affects your business or if it’s just background noise.

Built on live data from more than [**15,000 organizations**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/), this update helps your team tighten detection focus and reduce blind spots:

* **See what matters first:** Identify threats targeting your market or region so you can prioritize high‑risk activity.

* **Triage faster:** Skip irrelevant alerts and go straight to the ones that match your exposure.

* **Work with better insight:** Use targeted intelligence to guide hunts, automate enrichment, and improve MTTD.

With TI Lookup, you spot threats earlier, respond faster, and keep your attention where it counts.

The threat landscape changes fast
 Now your SOC can move with it

### AI Sigma Rules in ANY.RUN Sandbox

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image2-7.png)

The new **AI Sigma Rules** feature in the [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=AI_Sigma_Rules&utm_term=111225&utm_content=linktosandbox) turns your confirmed detections into ready‑to‑use Sigma rules automatically. Instead of spending hours writing them by hand, you can now take the rule straight from the sandbox and add it to your [SIEM or SOAR](https://any.run/integrations/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_25&utm_term=060126&utm_content=linktointegrations) in seconds.

The rules are created from the same processes, files, and network events you see in the sandbox, so they stay closely tied to real attacker behavior. That means better accuracy and quicker response without extra effort.

Here’s what you gain:

* **Less manual work:** Every confirmed threat instantly becomes a reusable detection rule.

* **Better coverage:** Each investigation now improves how your SOC spots similar attacks later.

* **Faster action:** Analysts spend less time writing rules and more time acting on real signals.

Cut MTTR by 21 min and reduce MTTD to 15 sec
