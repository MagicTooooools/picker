In a world where attention spans have been reduced to seconds, college students aren’t expected to read full books, AI is used to summarise anything more than a few sentences, and blogs have been largely replaced with microblogging platforms, is there still a place for long-form writing? In this essay I would like to explore that question; from how we got here to what hope we have for the future.

This is a complex topic, and to properly explore this, we need to go back several decades. What we see today are the symptoms of decades of changes and issues, layered one upon the other, building up to a far larger issue than what any of these could explain in isolation. While this essay goes on quite a journey, I believe that the journey is worthwhile and enlightening.

Before we truly begin, I must confess an important fact: despite the length of this document, the countless hours that have been spent in research, writing, and building up to this essay, the question it presents won’t be answered. While I intend to explore the question in detail, I won’t provide the answer. In reality, I don’t know. Long-form writing, as we know it, may be a dying art.

## Three-cueing vs. Phonics [#](#three-cueing-vs-phonics)

We start at the start, which is to say, how we learn to read. If you are not familiar with the three-cueing method, I suggest you read this, as this is critical to our analysis. If you are familiar, feel free to skip ahead.

Since as early as 1570, children in the English-speaking world have largely learned to read through a system that’s now called phonics. A system that focuses on the sounds associated with the letters & letter groups, allowing new readers to break down words into smaller components and work through those components individually. Phonics has strengths and weaknesses; it allows a reader encountering a new word to work through it to discover what it is with some effort. It’s also slow to show progress and frustrating for those learning to read.

In the 1960s, a new method was introduced that aimed to simplify learning, and allow new readers to achieve literacy faster. Three-cueing doesn’t focus on breaking words down to understand them, but using context clues to allow readers to make guided guesses[1](#fn:1). This system taught readers to look at three elements to identify context.

When a reader encounters a word they aren’t familiar with, they are taught to look for the following cues to identify the word:

* Visual: Looking at the first letters, word shape, letter clusters, visual alignment to other known words.
* Structure: Looking at the structure of the sentence to identify patterns, grammatical requirements, or other syntactic hints.
* Meaning: Looking for semantic hints, such as meaning of the sentence or prior sentences, context of the document so far, illustrations, and other hints that provide broader context.

Using these three-cues, new readers are taught to identify likely words, *guess* which is the best fitting, and if needed, to mentally *replace* the word with another that the reader knows.

This system is easier and faster to teach, and performs well in standardised tests where students can be prepared for a limited and consistent set of words that they need to know. However, it has problems. Very serious problems.

The system was based on a flawed understanding of cognitive development, and resulted in teaching students a system that allowed them to gain some understanding of written words quickly. Though the system also resulted in students often not understanding texts, and different students coming away with substantially different interpretations of the same text[2](#fn:2). Those that learned to read with this method struggle to understand new words, and struggle with comprehension, due to replacing or skipping unknown words.

In 2020, one study showed that 75% of teachers in the US were teaching the three-cues method. However, this is changing as the issues with the method are becoming better known, and at least 12 states have now banned the method.

> […] the student told Dames that, at her public high school, she had never been required to read an entire book. She had been assigned excerpts, poetry, and news articles, but not a single book cover to cover. - *[The Elite College Students Who Can’t Read Books](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/)*

As this method of teaching reading has spread, schools have also reduced the quantity of reading expected of students. Students are struggling to finish even simple reading assignments, struggling to understand what they read[3](#fn:3), and become overwhelmed when asked to read lengthy or complex texts.

> […] we are in new territory when even highly motivated honors students struggle to grasp the basic argument of a 20-page article - *[Adam Kotsko](https://slate.com/human-interest/2024/02/literacy-crisis-reading-comprehension-college.html)*

The simple version of all this is, unfortunately, teaching methods have failed to prepare children to read. Choices that were made over the last few decades are coming into full relief, and the picture is disturbing.

## Micro-Content & Micro-Dopamine [#](#micro-content--micro-dopamine)

With the words “just setting up my twttr” Jack Dorsey started a revolution. Twitter was focused on short but high volume content, with a focus on interaction over quality. Micro-blogging was born. Short posts, drops in a firehose, most with a half-life measured in hours or even minutes[4](#fn:4).

If you didn’t get a re-tweet or reply or like within the first few minutes, it was probably a miss. Might as well delete it and try something else to see if that one lands. The search for those tiny hits of dopamine started as soon as Twitter started.

Due to the small post size supported, thoughts had to be compressed, vocabulary limited to the shortest words available, commentary limited. Like the previous sentence, the posts were limited to 140 characters, a painful limitation that made clarity difficult and precision nearly impossible.

Then there was Instagram. Photos, just photos. A way to share filtered views of everyday life. The next step was [Vine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_%28service%29), a service that allowed users to view, create, and share 6-second looping videos. Tiny content, tiny dopamine hits.

From here, we all know how things have evolved. TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, and countless others.

The impacts of poor reading skills continue to compound as social media was reshaped to focus on shorter content, with compressed vocabularies, and an increased focus on achieving quick dopamine hits over meaningful communication.

## Writing but not Reading [#](#writing-but-not-reading)

If you include self-published books, it’s [estimated](https://www.tonerbuzz.com/blog/how-many-books-are-published-each-year/) that up to 4,000,000 books are published every year. Yet sales are often far worse than disappo...
