5 Ways MSSPs Can Win Clients in 2026

By 2026, [MSSPs](https://any.run/mssp/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mssp-win-clients-with-tifeeds&utm_term=080126&utm_content=linktomssplanding) will compete less on tooling and more on clarity, speed, and foresight. Security buyers want proof that their provider understands what threats matter now, how fast they can respond, and how security decisions reduce business risk.

At the center of this challenge sits threat intelligence. Not as a research output, but as an operational input shaping every security decision.

## What Clients Will Demand This Year: The Five Deciding Factors

Winning deals in 2026 means excelling where others fall short. Prospects grill providers on these five areas before signing:

* **Relentless Threat Blocking:**They want evidence you’re stopping attacks they can’t see coming.

* **Clean, Actionable Alerts:**Too many false positives waste time and erode confidence.

* **Blazing-Fast Incident Response**: Slow containment turns small incidents into headline breaches.

* **Forward-Leaning Threat Hunting**: Reactive-only services feel outdated in a zero-trust world.

* **Undeniable ROI Visibility:**Executives need clear proof of risks blocked and value delivered.

Master these with actionable threat intelligence, and you’ll close more deals while your competitors hassle.

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mssp-win-clients-with-tifeeds&utm_term=080126&utm_content=linktotifeedslanding) contain real-time streams of malicious IPs, domains, and URLs pulled from millions of sandbox submissions, updated frequently to keep you ahead. TI Feeds are not background data. They are the operational core of detection, response, hunting, reporting, and proactive defense.

Here are the five ways to stand out by employing real-time trustworthy threat data.

## 1. Early awareness defines credibility

Clients rarely see the attacks you stop. They only notice the ones you miss. One successful intrusion can erase years of good service and trigger immediate vendor reassessment.

The difficulty lies in the speed of attacker adaptation. Malware changes quickly, infrastructure rotates, and indicators expire fast. Detection logic based on static or delayed intelligence struggles to keep pace.

**What mature threat intelligence enables:**

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screen04.png)

ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds deliver continuously updated indicators along with sandbox analyses documenting attacker behavior extracted from live malware execution. For MSSPs, this means:

* Detection rules that evolve as threats evolve;

* Faster identification of emerging malware families;

* Visibility into infrastructure used in active attacks;

* Reduced reliance on outdated or recycled indicators.

Instead of reacting to incidents reported elsewhere, your MSSP detects threats while competitors are still catching up. For clients, that difference is felt as safety, not statistics.

Build a retention-first security service
with real-time, 99% unique threat intelligence

## 2. Response matters more than perfection

No MSSP can prevent every incident. What matters is how quickly and confidently you respond. Long investigations, unclear answers, and delayed containment create anxiety at the executive level.

Most delays come from context gaps. Analysts must validate indicators, understand attackers’ intent, and assess scope before acting. That takes time when intelligence is fragmented.

**TI Feeds give response teams immediate access to:**
