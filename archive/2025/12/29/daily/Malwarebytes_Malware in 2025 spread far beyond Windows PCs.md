# Malware in 2025 spread far beyond Windows PCs

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 29, 2025

*This blog is part of a series highlighting new and concerning trends we noticed over the last year. Trends matter because they almost always provide a good indication of what’s coming next.*

If there’s one thing that became very clear in 2025, it’s that [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) is no longer focused on Windows alone. We’ve seen some major developments, especially in campaigns targeting [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) and macOS. Unfortunately, many people still don’t realize that protecting smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices is just as essential as securing their laptops.

## Android

Banking Trojans on Android are not new, but their level of sophistication continues to rise. These threats continue to be a major problem in 2025, often disguising themselves as fake apps to steal credentials or stealthily take over devices. A recent wave of advanced banking Trojans, such as [Herodotus](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/herodotus-the-android-trojan-that-types-like-a-human/), can mimic human typing behaviors to evade detection, highlighting just how refined these attacks have become. Android malware also includes [adware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware) that aggressively pushes intrusive ads through free apps, degrading both the user experience and overall security.

Several Trojans were found to use [overlays](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/explained-android-overlays-and-how-they-are-used-to-trick-people), which are fake login screens appearing on top of real banking and [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) apps. They can read what’s on the screen, so when someone enters their username and password, the malware steals them.

## macOS

One of the most notable developments for Mac users was the expansion of the notorious ClickFix campaign to macOS. Early in 2025, I [described](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/clipboard-hijacker-tries-to-install-a-trojan) how criminals used fake CAPTCHA sites and a clipboard hijacker to provide instructions that led visitors ro infect their own machines with the Lumma infostealer.

ClickFix is the name researchers have since given to this type of campaign, where users are tricked into running malicious commands themselves. On macOS, this technique is being used to distribute both [AMOS stealers](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/atomic-stealer-now-using-clipboard-hijacking-to-target-macs/) and the [Rhadamanthys infostealer](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/new-clickfix-wave-infects-users-with-hidden-malware-in-images-and-fake-windows-updates).

## Cross-platform

Malware developers increasingly use cross-platform languages such as [Rust](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/01/google-to-support-the-use-of-rust-in-chromium) and [Go](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/fake-linkedin-jobs-trick-mac-users-into-downloading-flexible-ferret-malware#disqus_thread) to create malware that can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile, and even [Internet of Things (IoT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/iot)) devices. This enables flexible targeting and expands the number of potential victims. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) models are on th...
