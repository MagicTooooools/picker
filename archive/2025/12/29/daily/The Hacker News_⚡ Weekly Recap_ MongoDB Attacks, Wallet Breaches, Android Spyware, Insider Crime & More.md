[![Weekly Recap](data:image/png;base64... "Weekly Recap")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrlyxi5CiR5jY-vAJtPcjpGz_L8q6_hbThbQ6ZRXd0HLNpNxG4_KNwle_7EXt_ecUGABpDmjxO2bLwLPfjUmWKfTwuP0Lh910lNr4TE6q2MAm44XQzS2k0b9RJTr1aA74Q_aNkz9frFFNZjlGuafhIChvMiOpQhzD7OfEpXZZhh_GRntRLqmRtmsdrW1NX/s790-rw-e365/recap.jpg)

Last week's cyber news in 2025 was not about one big incident. It was about many small cracks opening at the same time. Tools people trust every day behave in unexpected ways. Old flaws resurfaced. New ones were used almost immediately.

A common theme ran through it all in 2025. Attackers moved faster than fixes. Access meant for work, updates, or support kept getting abused. And damage did not stop when an incident was "over" — it continued to surface months or even years later.

This weekly recap brings those stories together in one place. No overload, no noise. Read on to see what shaped the threat landscape in the final stretch of 2025 and what deserves your attention now.

## **⚡ Threat of the Week**

**[MongoDB Vulnerability Comes Under Attack](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/mongodb-vulnerability-cve-2025-14847.html)** — A newly disclosed security vulnerability in MongoDB has come under active exploitation in the wild, with over 87,000 potentially susceptible instances identified across the world. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-14847 (CVSS score: 8.7), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely leak sensitive data from the MongoDB server memory. It has been codenamed MongoBleed. The exact details surrounding the nature of attacks exploiting the flaw are presently unknown. Users are advised to update to MongoDB versions 8.2.3, 8.0.17, 7.0.28, 6.0.27, 5.0.32, and 4.4.30. Data from attack surface management company Censys shows that there are more than 87,000 potentially vulnerable instances, with a majority of them located in the U.S., China, Germany, India, and France. Wiz noted that 42% of cloud environments have at least one instance of MongoDB in a version vulnerable to CVE-2025-14847. This includes both internet-exposed and internal resources.

## **🔔 Top News**

* **[Trust Wallet Chrome Extension Hack Leads to $7M Loss](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/trust-wallet-chrome-extension-bug.html)** — Trust Wallet urged users to update its Google Chrome extension to the latest version following what it described as a "security incident" that led to the loss of approximately $7 million. Users are advised to update to version 2.69 as soon as possible. "We've confirmed that approximately $7 million has been impacted, and we will ensure all affected users are refunded," Trust Wallet said. The Chrome extension has about 1 million users. Mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions are not affected. It's currently not known who is behind the attack, but Trust Wallet said the attacker likely published a malicious version (2.68) by using a leaked Chrome Web Store API key. Affected victims have been asked to fill out a form to process reimbursements.
* **[Evasive Panda Stages DNS Poisoning Attack to Push MgBot Malware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/china-linked-evasive-panda-ran-dns.html)** — A China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Evasive Panda was attributed to a highly-targeted cyber espionage campaign in which the adversary poisoned Domain Name System (DNS) requests to deliver its signature MgBot backdoor in attacks targeting victims in Türkiye, China, and India. The activity took place between November 2022 and November 2024. According to Kaspersky, the hacking group conducted adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks on specific victims to serve trojanized updates for popular tools like SohuVA, iQIYI Video, IObit Smart Defrag, and Tencent QQ that ultimately deployed MgBot, a modular implant with wide-ranging information gathering capabilities. It's currently not known how the threat actor is poisoning DNS responses. But two possible scenarios are suspected: either the ISPs used by the victims were selectively targeted and compromised to install some kind of network implant on edge devices, or a router or firewall used by the victims was hacked for this purpose.
* **[LastPass 2022 Breach Leads to Crypto Theft](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/lastpass-2022-breach-led-to-years-long.html)** — The encrypted vault backups stolen from the 2022 LastPass data breach enabled bad actors to take advantage of weak master passwords to crack them open and drain cryptocurrency assets as recently as late 2025. New findings from TRM Labs show that threat actors with possible ties to the Russian cybercriminal ecosystem have stolen no less than $35 million as of September 2025. The Russian links to the stolen cryptocurrency stem from two primary factors: The use of exchanges commonly associated with the Russian cybercriminal ecosystem in the laundering pipeline and operational connections gleaned from wallets interacting with mixers both before and after the mixing and laundering process.
* **[Fortinet Warns of Renewed Activity Exploiting CVE-2020-12812](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fortinet-warns-of-active-exploitation.html)** — Fortinet said it observed "recent abuse" of CVE-2020-12812, a five-year-old security flaw in FortiOS SSL VPN, in the wild under certain configurations. The vulnerability could allow a user to log in successfully without being prompted for the second factor of authentication if the case of the username was changed. The newly issued guidance does not give any specifics on the nature of the attacks exploiting the flaw, nor whether any of those incidents were successful. Fortinet has also advised impacted customers to contact its support team and reset all credentials if they find evidence of admin or VPN users being auth...
