EFF’s attorneys, activists, and technologists don’t just do the hard, endless work of defending our digital civil liberties — they also spend a lot of time and effort explaining that work to the public via media interviews.

EFF had thousands of media mentions in 2025, from the smallest hyperlocal outlets to international news behemoths. Our work on street-level surveillance — the technology that police use to spy on our communities — generated a great deal of press attention, particularly regarding automated license plate readers (ALPRs). But we also got a lot of ink and airtime for our three lawsuits against the federal government: one challenging the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's illegal data sharing, a second challenging the State Department's unconstitutional "catch and revoke" program, and the third demanding that the departments of State and Justice reveal what pressure they put on app stores to remove ICE-tracking apps.

Other hot media topics included how travelers can protect themselves against searches of their devices, how protestors can protect themselves from surveillance, and the misguided age-verification laws that are proliferating across the nation and around the world, which are an attack on privacy and free expression.

On national television, [Matthew Guariglia spoke with NBC Nightly News](https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/police-tap-into-doorbell-cameras-to-fight-crime-237925445591) to discuss how more and more police agencies are using private doorbell cameras to surveil neighborhoods. [Tori Noble spoke with ABC’s Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/video/124200504) about the dangers of digital price tags, as well as [with ABC News Live Prime](https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/privacy-concerns-new-open-ai-web-browser-126779458?fromLive=true) about privacy concerns over OpenAI’s new web browser.
