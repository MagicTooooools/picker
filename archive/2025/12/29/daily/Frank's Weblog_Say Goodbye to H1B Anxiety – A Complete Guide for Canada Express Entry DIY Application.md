中文版：[告别H1B焦虑 – 加拿大Express Entry DIY全流程指南 – Frank’s Weblog](https://nyan.im/p/canada-express-entry-zh)

In 2023, I began considering Canada’s Express Entry after failing the H1B lottery three times. After a challenging two-year journey, I finally became a Canadian Permanent Resident in 2025. This article details the entire process of applying for and receiving Canadian PR from abroad through the French language category.

This article serves only as a sharing of personal experience and does not constitute legal advice. My application took place in mid-2025, and the information may become inaccurate over time. If you have questions regarding your application, please refer to the official websites of relevant departments or hire a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) for consultation.

## What is Express Entry?

Express Entry (EE) is the most mainstream, convenient, and efficient pathway for skilled immigration to Canada. The way it works is to score applicants via the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The main metrics include age, education, language, and work experience. Typically, every two weeks, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) conducts draws. A cutoff score is determined based on the score of candidates in the pool and the number of profiles they intend to invite. Applicants meeting this score receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) and submit their application. Most EE applications receive a decision within 6 months.

### The Current Status of Express Entry

Since the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program only requires one year of non-Canadian work experience and language scores, it looks very appealing. So, can I apply for PR directly from abroad even if I have never been to Canada? Yes and no. It was possible in the past, but starting from 2024, due to social issues arising from excessive immigration and temporary residents, Canadian immigration began to tighten rapidly. FSW and “General” draws have been paused since the last draw in April 2024 ([#294](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds/invitations.html?q=294)). Currently, the only pathway for overseas applicants is through category-based draws. Common categories are French language proficiency, healthcare, and education.

## Preparation

After deciding to pursue Express Entry, you first need to clarify which program’s basic requirements you meet, collect relevant information for creating the Express Entry profile, and use a CRS calculator to calculate the score: [Express Entry: Check your score – Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/check-score.html)

Express Entry has four categories, the most common ones are Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) and Canadian Experience Class (CEC). In most cases, FSW applies to applicants with (only) non-Canadian work experience, while CEC applies to applicants with work experience in Canada.

### Work Experience

When creating the profile, you need to determine your Primary NOC. You need to fill in basic information for each work experience, but no need to provide proof at this stage. However! Relevant supporting documents will be required when filing the application.

### English/French Scores

Available English tests include IELTS, CELPIP, and PTE. I personally believe that if you have lived in an English-speaking country, CELPIP is the easier to get a high score. If you want to pursue the French category, you need French scores of CLB/NCLC 7 in all four skills. Only one language score is needed for creating the profile, but French combined with English scores can add 50 extra bilingual bonus.

I completed the CELPIP exam at the end of 2023 with scores of Listening 11, Reading 12, Writing 9, Speaking 9. To get CLB 10 to max out language points, I requested a re-evaluation for speaking and writing, and the scores after re-evaluation were 11/12/11/10.

### Education Credential Assessment (ECA)

Any non-Canadian degree requires an [Educational Credential Assessment (ECA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessment.html) to be used in Express Entry, but only the highest degree needs to be assessed. Common assessments include WES and CES. If using a Chinese degree, an extra step involving CHSI (学信网) is needed, which may take 1-2 months to complete. US/European degrees are usually easier, simply order a transcript via Parchment and send it to WES/CES,it typically takes 15-30 days. The ECA is valid for 5 years. If using WES, ensure you apply for [WES ECA](https://www.wes.org/eca/), not the WES for school applications.

The spouse/partner’s education does not need an ECA if not claiming points.

## Creating Profile

After completing the items above, you can create a Profile in the IRCC Online Service/GCKey[\*] (commonly known as entering the pool). The Express Entry Profile consists of 6 forms: Personal details, Contact details, Study and languages, Application details, Representative, and Work history. It is pretty straightforward. After creating the profile, you can update your profile at any time based on the latest situation, such as updating language scores, adding/removing work experience, or adding/removing accompanying spouse/partner/children.

\*: This system is called IRCC Online Service, but because it uses GCKey to log in, it is often referred to as GCKey.

In February 2024, after I got my CELPIP scores and reached three years of work experience, I entered the pool with 481 points.

After entering the pool, it was a long wait. At the time, the situation for EE and Canadian immigration as a whole was not as bad as it is now. For candidates without Canadian education and experience, to get an invitation via general draws, STEM category draws, or OINP HCP was completely feasible.

Not long after I entered the pool, two [OINP HCP Tech](https://www.ontario.ca/page/oinp-tech-draws) draws occurred, b...
