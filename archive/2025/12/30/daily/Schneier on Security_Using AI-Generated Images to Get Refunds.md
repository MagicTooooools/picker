Fake damage photos after a booking, so the guest gets charged for damages.
Yet another reason to avoid Airbnb.

Strange that you would tag China in this post without any supporting context. I assume this is happening in the western world or is it ooh bad China or nasty China Ai. Nobody would dream of doing such a horrid thing in England or the goodie two shoes USA with western Ai tools, would they?

*Your blog is terrific by the way.*

The title of the linked article is litteraly : “Scammers in China Are Using AI-Generated Images to Get Refunds”

@ ALL,

The wired article is reproduced from an earlier article about the Chinese online ecommerce scams.

Toward’s the end it notes that the scams started with retailers and then the purchasers.

Which is actually not that surprising as “honesty in marketing” legislation is generally quite low in most countries as online retailing is only a recent phenomenon from this century. Where as purchasers are legislated against more thoroughly by legislation on “theft and fraud” that often pre-dates not just ecommerce but goes back two or three centuries.

At the bottom of the article we find,

> *”But really, these trends are two sides of the same problem: Ecommerce relies heavily on trust, and widespread availability of AI is making it increasingly difficult to operate under the assumption that the majority of people are honest actors.”*

AI easily breaks “trust and honesty” but all to often does not suffer reputational harm. And even where AI has broken the rules on “honesty and trust” the nature of the ecommerce markets, are that they are so separated out. That reputational harm is unlikely to be known to either party in a transaction.

This was an issue Prof Ross j Anderson had considered but came up with little to resolve it.

In fact the notion of ensuring trust in ecommerce is almost ridiculous because of the distance between retailers and purchases.

The normal suggestion is to insert a third party into the system to act as an observer. However it does not take long to realise that that will not resolve the issue.

Back last century was the Vesa-Mastercard system called “Secure Electronic Transactions”(SET) which was a horrific set of ASN.1 rules, but it failed. Mostly because perchasers did not want the level of security given.

Of all the telltale signs of an AI-generated crab: *“One of them also had nine instead of eight legs.”* 🙂

In a [video](https://youtu.be/7PL-ofh-6iA?si=dG-AtM154JUTQFQn&t=699) a Yunnan lawyer reportedly outlines the penalties.

Fraudulent refunds over $424 are a criminal offense. Amounts over $4,240 could result in 3 to 10 years imprisonment. If under $424, the AI dilettante can be detained for 5 to 10 days and fined $283. Note: I don’t know if these are yuan conversions?

Shoot the Messenger:
wired(dot)com is broken for me. Oh, I can connect and get the page and wired keeps on downloading garbage at 10Mbits/sec for a further 10 seconds. Using curl to dump the page to a text file I find the page itself comes to 1.3MBytes of scripts and trackers concealing 8kB (including markup) of useful text.

@Bruce’s headline says “Using AI-Generated Images to Get Refunds”
but wired emphasises the evidence showing Chinese engaging in criminal activity. Will this crime cause as much damage to the US economy as misquided tariffs?

@KC: yes, the values have been translated for a US audience, US$424 = CNY3000. And I have my doubts about some similar videos on YT where the “other language” voice-overs are AI. On the one you quoted it is almost impossible to hear what the Chinese lawyer is saying.

So, somebody’s smart idea of saving the vendor and customer the hassle of shipping back physical goods, looks to be not so smart. I had the experience this year of a small electronic device that failed after 2 days use. The vendor requested photos, which I thought was daft. Apart from the pre-AI possibility of Photoshop, how could a photo show a calculating device not calculating?

True crabs (and many other crustaceans called “crab”) are decapod crustaceans. “Decapod” means “ten legs”.

It’s arachnids that more often have eight legs.

Scamming is everywhere these days.

Saw on Reddit earlier today where this guy got rocks instead of his Geforce RTX 5080.
