## AIs Exploiting Smart Contracts

I have long maintained that smart contracts are a dumb idea: that a human process is actually a security feature.

Here’s some [interesting research](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/smart-contracts/) on training AIs to automatically exploit smart contracts:

> AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we’ve [written about before](https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/). But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/) and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts on [Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)](https://github.com/safety-research/SmartContract-bench)­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth $4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense.

From the research:

> Open-source codebases, like smart contracts, may be the first to face this wave of automated, tireless scrutiny.
>
> But it is unlikely that proprietary software will remain unstudied for long, as agents become better at reverse engineering.

No one can not use AI for defense IMO.

> In our experiment, it costs just $1.22 on average for an agent to exhaustively scan a contract for vulnerability.

The exploit returns are so incredibly profitable and the AIs are only getting better.
