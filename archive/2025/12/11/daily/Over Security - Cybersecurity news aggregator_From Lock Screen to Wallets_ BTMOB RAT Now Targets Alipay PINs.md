# From Lock Screen to Wallets: BTMOB RAT Now Targets Alipay PINs

Researched by: Vishnu Madhav and Rajat Goyal

## Executive Summary

On February 12, [Cyble](https://cyble.com/blog/btmob-rat-newly-discovered-android-malware/) reported the discovery of a new variant of the BTMOB spyware, named BTMOB RAT v2.5. This malicious software is being distributed through deceptive phishing sites impersonating popular streaming services like iNat TV and fraudulent cryptocurrency mining platforms (Fig.1).

Subsequently, our zLabs team conducted a more in-depth investigation and uncovered several additional versions of the spyware: v2.6, v2.7, v2.8, v2.9 and the most recent version v3.1 and v3.2. This latest version is being disguised as an update and is being spread through various phishing sites. In total, our researchers uncovered 32 droppers and 44 payloads with the droppers posing as legitimate applications such as GB whatsapp, chrome, Roku, Bradesco, Kaspersky, Venmo and several others.

## Distribution Method

The dropper is delivered through fake websites carefully designed to trick unsuspecting users. Our investigation uncovered 3 newly active websites involved in this campaign. Notably, one of the sites specifically targets the Turkish Ministry of Justice, as shown in Figure 2.

During our analysis, the team discovered open directories being used to distribute the malware, as shown in Figure 3.

Within these open directories we also found the presence of several Windows executable files, which appear to be associated with ConnectWise, a legitimate remote administration tool commonly used by IT professionals for remote support and system management. The fact that these executables were present alongside the malware samples raises concerns. It suggests that the attackers might misuse these tools to gain unauthorized access to compromised systems or to make their malicious activity look like normal administrative activity.

## Technical Analysis

As we noted in our original blogpost, earlier versions of the spyware were delivered as standalone payloads. However, this latest version has changed its approach and now uses dropper as its delivery method.

Once the dropper is installed, the malware employs a deceptive tactic to lure the victim into downloading its payload onto the mobile device. It presents a fake update screen designed to appear legitimate, tricking the user into starting the download of the malicious update (Fig. 4).

The actual payload of the malware is hidden within the Assets folder of the application. When ...
