AI Sigma Rules: Scale Threat Detection, Drive Down MTTR

Security teams face thousands of alerts every single day. Many of them don’t clearly show whether there’s a true threat behind them. Investigation slows down, analysts lose time on low-value signals, and important findings are often buried in noise.

**AI Sigma Rules change this routine.** With this new capability in [ANY.RUN’s](https://any.run/) Interactive Sandbox, SOC teams can not only see the source of malicious activity in the standard Sigma format but also use the generated rules across their entire environment. Every confirmed threat now actively improves how your SOC detects the next one and speeds up response.

## The Challenge: From Alert Overload to Actionable Knowledge

Most SOCs struggle to turn threats they identify into reusable, scalable detection logic. The obstacles pile up quickly:

* **Hard to share knowledge:** Insights often stay with the analyst who handled the case instead of becoming team-wide detection logic.

* **Manual rule creation:** Turning attack behavior into a working rule takes time, testing, and trial-and-error.

* **Dependency on a few experts:** Only senior engineers usually know how to write or adapt rules for each platform.

* **Slow improvement cycles:** Even when analysts uncover something important, converting it into broader protection takes too long.

All of this results in the same issue: SOCs fix individual incidents, but the lessons don’t consistently carry over into stronger detection coverage.

## How ANY.RUN Solves It with AI Sigma Rules

AI Sigma Rules automate one of the slowest and most error-prone parts of detection engineering: turning real attack behavior into usable detection logic.

Instead of manually translating sandbox findings into rules, teams receive a ready-to-review Sigma rule built directly from the recorded malicious activity.

Each rule is generated from what actually happened during execution; the same events, processes, and fields analysts already trust during investigation. As a result, the detection logic stays closely tied to real attacker behavior, not assumptions or static indicators.

With AI Sigma Rules, SOC teams can:

* **Understand the root cause** of detections by seeing the exact events and fields that triggered them.

* **Leverage industry-standard threat descriptions** for seamless integration with security workflows.

* **Deploy rules directly** to SIEM, SOC, or EDR tools to strengthen defenses.

* **Accelerate incident response** by reducing mean time to resolve (MTTR).

For security leaders, this changes the value of every investigation. A confirmed detection no longer ends with a closed alert but becomes a chance to strengthen the whole infrastructure.

## How AI Sigma Rules Work

Let’s take a closer look at how you can quickly get an actionable Sigma rule inside ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox.

**1. Submit a suspicious file or URL**
Run the sample in ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=AI_Sigma_Rules&utm_term=111225&utm_content=linktoregistration) to observe its behavior in real time.

**2. Wait for a detection to trigger**
As soon as malicious activity is confirmed, the sandbox highlights the event and prepares the data behind it.

**3. Open the AI Sigma Rules panel**
Inside the detection view, you’ll see a generated Sigma rule that reflects the exact logic behind the alert, including key event fields and matching conditions.
