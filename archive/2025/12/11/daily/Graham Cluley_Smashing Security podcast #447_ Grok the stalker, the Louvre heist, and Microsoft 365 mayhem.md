On this week’s show we learn that AI really can be a stalker’s best friend, as we explore a strange tale that starts with a manatee-shaped mailbox on a millionaire’s lawn and ends with Grok happily doxxing real people, mapping out stalking “strategies,” and handing out revenge-porn tips.

Then we go inside the Louvre heist, where thieves in hi-vis and a hire van waltzed off with the French crown jewels in broad daylight, exploiting our assumptions about what “looks normal” – the same kind of bias we’re now baking into security AIs.

Plus, Graham chats with Rob Edmondson from CoreView about why misconfigurations and over-privileged accounts can make Microsoft 365 dangerously vulnerable.

All this, and more, in episode 447 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with Graham Cluley, and special guest Jenny Radcliffe.
