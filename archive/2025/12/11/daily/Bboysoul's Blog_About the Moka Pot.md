## What is a Moka Pot

The Moka Pot is a classic steam pressure coffee maker that originated in Italy, mainly used for making espresso-like beverages at home in a simple and quick way. It is popular among coffee lovers worldwide due to its simple structure, easy operation, and affordable price.

## Why I Chose a Moka Pot

A big reason for buying a Moka Pot was due to digital fatigue—there was really nothing left to tinker with. Plus, I have a preference for things with a sense of history, so I got myself a Bialetti Moka Pot.

I bought the **single-valve, 2-cup version**. The single valve is cheaper than the double valve, and I personally feel it’s sufficient.

## My Coffee Brewing Process

There are many tutorials online that are particular about water-to-coffee ratios, water temperature, and other mystical details, but my approach is—go with the flow, whatever is convenient.

### 1. Prepare the Coffee Grounds

I use ready-made Moka Pot-specific coffee grounds (medium roast illy Moka grounds, **make sure to buy grounds specifically for Moka Pots**).

Of course, you can also buy beans and grind them yourself, but I don’t want the hassle—using pre-ground coffee works just fine.

### 2. Prepare the Water

Some people online say 50 degrees, others say 60 degrees. I just use whatever temperature water I have. If I don’t have any, I just pour tap water directly.

**Note**: The water should not exceed the safety valve. The exact amount is flexible, just about right.

### 3. Add the Coffee

* Want it stronger: Fill it up and press down firmly
* Want it lighter: Just add some casually

### 4. Assemble

**Make sure to screw it tight**. Nothing else to worry about.

### 5. Heat and Extract

I use a gas stove:

1. Turn on the heat first, then adjust to **low heat**
2. **Open the lid** before placing the Moka Pot on the stove to make it easier to observe the coffee liquid
3. When the coffee liquid just covers the bottom, **turn off the heat**
4. Let the residual heat continue the extraction

### 6. Make Your Beverage

**Americano (black coffee)**: Just add water. Add less if you want it stronger. Go with what feels right.

**Latte**: Add milk. I prefer sweet milk, but almost everything on the market is plain milk. You can heat the milk since lattes should be served hot. How much milk to add is also up to you.

### 7. Cleaning and Maintenance

1. Rinse the Moka Pot under cold running water
2. Disassemble and rinse with clean water
3. **Do not use dish soap**—clean water is enough

**First-time use**: It’s recommended to brew two cups of coffee using the above method and discard them to clean the Moka Pot.
