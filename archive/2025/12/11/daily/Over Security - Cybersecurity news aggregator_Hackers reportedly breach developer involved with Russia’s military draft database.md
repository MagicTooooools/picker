# Hackers reportedly breach developer involved with Russia’s military draft database

An anonymous hacker group has reportedly breached the servers of a little-known Russian tech firm alleged to be involved in building the country’s unified military registration database.

According to Grigory Sverdlov, head of the Russian anti-war human rights group [Idite Lesom](https://t.me/iditelesom_help/6625) (“Get Lost”), the hackers contacted him and handed over a trove of internal Mikord documents, including source code, technical and financial records, and internal correspondence. Sverdlov said the group claimed it had maintained access to Mikord’s systems for several months and had destroyed parts of the company’s infrastructure.

Idite Lesom, which helps Russians evade conscription and mobilization, has been labeled a “foreign agent” by Moscow. Sverdlov himself faces criminal charges for allegedly spreading “fake news” about the Russian military.

Mikord’s website has been offline for days, showing only a maintenance message. Earlier this month, the company’s homepage was defaced by hackers who said they intended to give the stolen materials to journalists and later publish them publicly.

The company, which provides software development and automation services for government agencies and major corporations, has never publicly acknowledged any role in developing Russia’s new military registry. But Latvia-based investigative outlet Important Stories (iStories) [said](https://storage.googleapis.com/istories/news/2025/12/11/khakeri-vzlomali-infrastrukturu-odnogo-iz-klyuchevikh-razrabotchikov-yedinogo-reestra-voinskogo-ucheta/index.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=mainpage) it verified the leaked materials and confirmed Mikord’s participation in the project.

Mikord’s director, Ramil Gabdrakhmanov, admitted to iStories that the firm had been hacked. “It happens to everyone. Lots of people are being attacked these days,” he told the outlet. He declined to comment on whether the company worked on the military database.

Russia’s Ministry of Defense [dismissed](https://t.me/mod_russia/59313) the reports on Thursday, calling claims of a breach “untrue.” The registry, it said, “is operating normally,” and no personal data leaks have occurred. The ministry added that the system is frequently targeted but that all attacks have been “successfully stopped.”

The unified military registration database stores detailed personal data on all military-eligible citizens. It is designed to streamline mobilization and replace the Soviet-era paper registration system used by local draft offices.

The identity and origin of the hacker group are unknown. Recorded Future News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the documents the hackers provided to Russian media and the human rights group.

Earlier in December, suspected Russian hackers [targeted](https://therecord.media/ukraine-government-cyberattack-state-registers-russia) multiple Ukrainian state registries — systems holding biometric data, property records, court rulings, business information, and tax documents — and briefly disrupted Reserve+, Ukraine’s digital military service app.
