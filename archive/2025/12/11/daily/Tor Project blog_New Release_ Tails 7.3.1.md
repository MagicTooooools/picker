# New Release: Tails 7.3.1

by [tails](/author/tails)
| December 11, 2025

![](/new-release-tails-7_3_1/lead.jpg)

Today, we are releasing 7.3.1 instead of 7.3 because a security vulnerability
was fixed in a software library included in Tails while we were preparing 7.3.
We started the release process again to include this fix.

## Changes and updates

* Update *Tor Browser* to [15.0.3](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1503).
* Update the *Tor* client to 0.4.8.21.
* Update *Thunderbird* to [140.5.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/140.5.0esr/releasenotes/).

For more details, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).

## Get Tails 7.3.1

### To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

* Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 7.0 or later to 7.3.1.
* If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an automatic upgrade, please try to do a [manual upgrade](https://tails.net/doc/upgrade/#manual).

### To install Tails 7.3.1 on a new USB stick

Follow our installation instructions:

* [Install from Windows](https://tails.net/install/windows/)
* [Install from macOS](https://tails.net/install/mac/)
* [Install from Linux](https://tails.net/install/linux/)
* [Install from Debian or Ubuntu using the command line and GnuPG](https://tails.net/install/expert/)

The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if you install instead of
upgrading.

### To download only

If you don't need installation or upgrade instructions, you can download Tails
7.3.1 directly:

* [For USB sticks (USB image)](https://tails.net/install/download/)
* [For DVDs and virtual machines (ISO image)](https://tails.net/install/download-iso/)
