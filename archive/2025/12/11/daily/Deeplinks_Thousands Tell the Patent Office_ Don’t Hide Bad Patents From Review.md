A massive wave of public comments just told the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): don’t shut the public out of patent review.

EFF submitted its own formal comment opposing the USPTO’s proposed rules, and more than 4,000 supporters added their voices—an extraordinary response for a technical, fast-moving rulemaking. We comprised more than one-third of the [11,442 comments submitted](https://www.regulations.gov/document/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001/comment). The message is unmistakable: the public wants a meaningful way to challenge bad patents, and the USPTO should not take that away.

### **The Public Doesn’t Want To Bury Patent Challenges**

These thousands of submissions do more than express frustration. They demonstrate overwhelming public interest in preserving inter partes review (IPR), and undermine any broad claim that the USPTO’s proposal reflects public sentiment.

Comments opposing the rulemaking include many small business owners who have been wrongly accused of patent infringement, by both patent trolls and patent-abusing competitors. They also include computer science experts, law professors, and everyday technology users who are simply tired of patent extortion—abusive assertions of low-quality patents—and the harm it inflicts on their work, their lives, and the broader U.S. economy.

The USPTO exists to serve the public. The volume and clarity of this response make that expectation impossible to ignore.
