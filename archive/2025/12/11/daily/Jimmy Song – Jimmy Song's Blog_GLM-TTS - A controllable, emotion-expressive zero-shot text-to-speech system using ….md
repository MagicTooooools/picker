# GLM-TTS

A controllable, emotion-expressive zero-shot text-to-speech system using multi-reward reinforcement learning.

Author:

## Detailed Introduction

GLM‑TTS is a text-to-speech (TTS) project released by Zai that focuses on controllable generation of emotion and speaking style. The project uses multi-reward reinforcement learning in a zero-shot setting to enhance the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of synthesized speech, enabling the model to produce speech with specified emotions or styles even for unseen examples.

## Main Features

* Zero-shot emotional expression: generate speech with target emotions without specialized training samples.
* Strong controllability: multi-dimensional controls such as emotion intensity, speaking rate, and timbre.
* Multi-reward training: multiple reward signals optimize quality and emotional consistency.
* Open-source license: released under Apache-2.0 for community reuse and extension.

## Use Cases

* Voice assistants and dialogue systems: provide more natural and emotionally expressive responses.
* Audiobooks and content dubbing: automatically adapt narration style to content emotion.
* Rapid prototyping for new languages/styles: quick zero-shot experiments on novel styles or languages.
* Creative tools: give creators fine-grained control over speech style synthesis.

## Technical Features

* Model architecture combines extensible TTS backbones with emotion-conditioning modules.
* Training strategy employs multiple reward signals balancing perceptual quality, emotional alignment, and naturalness.
* Supports the PyTorch ecosystem for local or cloud fine-tuning and extension.
* The project is open-source on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-TTS); see the official site
