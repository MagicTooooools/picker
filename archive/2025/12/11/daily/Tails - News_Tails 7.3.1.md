# Tails 7.3.1

2025-12-11

* [announce](../../tags/announce/)

Today, we are releasing 7.3.1 instead of 7.3 because a security vulnerability
was fixed in a software library included in Tails while we were preparing 7.3.
We started the release process again to include this fix.

# Changes and updates

* Update *Tor Browser* to [15.0.3](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1503).
* Update the *Tor* client to 0.4.8.21.
* Update *Thunderbird* to [140.5.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/140.5.0esr/releasenotes/).

For more details, read our [changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).
