# OxyGent

A multi-agent collaboration framework for enterprise applications that emphasizes local-first workflow composition and tool integration.

Author:
JD

Since:
2025-07-18

[Visit Website](https://oxygent.jd.com) [GitHub](https://github.com/jd-opensource/oxygent)

## Detailed Introduction

Maintained by JD’s open source team, OxyGent provides a framework for orchestrating multiple agents in cooperative workflows. It focuses on a local-first, composable approach that lets developers define agents, tools, and permission boundaries, while a runtime engine handles task scheduling and inter-agent communication. The project includes example repositories and onboarding documentation to help enterprises pilot the framework in controlled environments.

## Main Features

* Local-first workflow engine supporting hybrid offline/online execution.
* Multi-agent collaboration model with task distribution, shared context, and callback mechanisms.
* Plugin-based tool integration for connecting databases, APIs, and external services.
* Built-in permissioning and audit capabilities to support compliance and traceability.

## Use Cases

OxyGent is suitable for enterprise scenarios that require coordination across multiple models or services, such as automated customer support, cross-system data processing, business process orchestration, and intelligent operations. Organizations can run small-scale pilots before expanding to production.

## Technical Features

* Implemented in the Python ecosystem for easy integration with backend systems.
* Supports composable agent definitions and finite-state control for testability and replayability.
* Exposes runtime metrics and audit logs for monitoring and compliance reviews.
* Open source license with an active community for extensibility and enterprise customization.
