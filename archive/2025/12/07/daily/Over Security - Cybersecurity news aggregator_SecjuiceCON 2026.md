SecjuiceCON 2026

SecjuiceCON is an online event for infosec and OSINT industry insiders, and we'd love for you to talk to our audience about your wisdom and learnings.

You might already know about our work, but Secjuice is the only [non-profit, independent, and volunteer-led publication](https://www.secjuice.com/about-us/) in the information security space.

We are a private members' writing club focused on cybersecurity, information security, hacking, and open-source intelligence gathering.

We believe that our value as professionals lies in our ability to share our research and knowledge with others through the written word.

We mentor hackers and help them prepare their research for publication.

Our members feel a strong sense of civic duty; it's what drives us to spread our knowledge and experiences with our community.

Defending the interests of those who hack is [within our remit](https://www.secjuice.com/about-us/).
