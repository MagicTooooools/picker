# Weak AVL Tree

tl;dr: Weak AVL trees are replacements for AVL trees and red-black
trees.

The 2014 paper [*Rank-Balanced
Trees*](https://sidsen.azurewebsites.net/papers/rb-trees-talg.pdf) (Haeupler, Sen, Tarjan) presents a framework using ranks
and rank differences to define binary search trees.

* Each node has a non-negative integer rank `r(x)`. Null
  nodes have rank -1.
* The rank difference of a node `x` with parent
  `p(x)` is `r(p(x)) â r(x)`.
* A node is `i,j` if its children have rank differences
  `i` and `j` (unordered), e.g., a 1,2 node has
  children with rank differences 1 and 2.
* A node is called 1-node if its rank difference is 1.

Several balanced trees fit this framework:

* AVL tree: Ranks are defined as heights. Every node is 1,1 or 1,2
  (rank differences of children)
* Red-Black tree: All rank differences are 0 or 1, and no parent of a
  0-child is a 0-child. (red: 0-child; black: 1-child; null nodes are
  black)
* Weak AVL tree (new tree described by this paper): All rank
  differences are 1 or 2, and every leaf has rank 0.
  + A weak AVL tree without 2,2 nodes is an AVL tree.

## Weak AVL Tree

Weak AVL trees are replacements for AVL trees and red-black trees. A
single insertion or deletion operation requires at most two rotations
(forming a double rotation when two are needed). In contrast, AVL
deletion requires O(log n) rotations, and red-black deletion requires up
to three.

Without deletions, a weak AVL tree is exactly an AVL tree. With
deletions, its height remains at most that of an AVL tree with the same
number of insertions but no deletions.

The rank rules imply:

* Null nodes have rank -1, leaves have rank 0, unary nodes have rank
  1.

### Insertion

The new node `x` has a rank of 0, changed from the null
node of rank -1. There are three cases.

* If the tree was previously empty, the new node becomes the
  root.
* If the parent of the new node was previously a unary node (1,2
  node), it is now a 1,1 binary node.
* If the parent of the new node was previously a leaf (1,1 node), it
  is now a 0,1 binary node, leading to a rank violation.

When the tree was previously non-empty, `x` has a parent
node. We call the following subroutine with `x` indicating
the new node to handle the second and third cases.

The following subroutine handles the rank increase of `x`.
We call `break` if there is no more rank violation, i.e. we
are done.

The 2014 paper isn't very clear about the conditions.

Promote p.     // Since we have promoted both x and p, it's as if rank_diff(x's sibling) is flipped.     // p is now a 1,2 node.          x = p;     p = p->parent;     // x is a 1,2 node.     if (!p) break;     d = p->ch[1] == x;        if (rank_diff(x) == 1) { break; }     // Otherwise, x is a 0-child, leading to a new rank violation.          auto sib = p->ch[!d];     if (rank_diff(sib) == 2) { // p is a 0,2 node       auto y = x->ch[d^1];       if (y && rank_diff(y) == 1) {         // y is a 1-child. y must the previous `x` in the last iteration.         Perform a double rotation involving `p`, `x`, and `y`.       } else {         // Otherwise, y is null or a 2-child.         Perform a single rotation involving `p` and `x`.         x is now a 1,1 node and there is no more violation.       }       break;     }        // Otherwise, p is a 0,1 node. Goto the next iteration.   } } ``` |

Insertion never introduces a 2,2 node, so insertion-only sequences
produce AVL trees.

### Deletion

TODO: Describe deletion

### Implementation

In 2020, FreeBSD has changed its `sys/tree.h` to use weak
AVL trees instead of red-black trees. <https://reviews.freebsd.org/D25480> The `rb_`
prefix remains as it can also indicate `Rank-Balanced`:)

Here is a C++ implementation with the following operations

* `insert`: insert a node
* `remove`: remove a node
* `rank`: count elements less than a key
* `select`: find the k-th smallest element (0-indexed)
* `prev`: find the largest element less than a key
* `next`: find the smallest element greater than a key

The insertion and deletion operations are inspired by the FreeBSD
implementation, with the insertion further optimized.

We encode rank differences instead of the absolute rank values. Since
valid rank differences can only be 1 or 2, a single bit suffices to
encode each. We take 2 bits from the `parent` pointer to
store the two child rank differences.

The paper suggests that each node can use one bit to encode its own
rank difference. However, this representation is not ideal. A null node
can be either a 1-child (parent is binary) or a 2-child (parent is
unary). Retrieving the child rank difference requires probing the
sibling node:

`int rank_diff(Node *p, int d) { return p->ch[d] ? p->ch[d]->par_and_flg & 1 : p->ch[!d] ? 2 : 1; }`
