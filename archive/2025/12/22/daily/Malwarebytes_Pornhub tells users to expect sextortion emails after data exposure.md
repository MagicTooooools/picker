# Pornhub tells users to expect sextortion emails after data exposure

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 22, 2025

![Pornhub logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Pornhub_logo.png?w=1200)

After a recent [data breach that affected Pornhub Premium members](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/12/soundcloud-pornhub-and-700credit-all-reported-data-breaches-but-the-similarities-end-there), Pornhub has updated its [online statement](https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/47334442459283-Important-Message-From-Pornhub) to warn users about potential direct contact from cybercriminals.

> “We are aware that the individuals responsible for this incident have threatened to contact impacted Pornhub Premium users directly. You may therefore receive emails claiming they have your personal information. As a reminder, we will never ask for your password or payment information by email.”

Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.

Pornhub has [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/12/16/pornhub-confirms-breach-user-search-watch-and-download-activity-stolen/) that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytics events for certain users.” Pornhub stressed that this was not a breach of Pornhub’s own systems, and said that passwords, payment details, and financial information were not exposed.

Mixpanel confirmed it experienced a security incident on November 8, 2025, but disputes that the Pornhub data originated from that breach. The company stated there is:

>  “No indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security incident or otherwise.”

Regardless of the source, cybercriminals commonly attempt to monetize stolen user data through direct extortion. At the moment, it is unclear how many users are affected, although available information suggests that only Premium members had their data exposed.

In October, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/press/2025/10/14/new-malwarebytes-research-reveals-that-one-in-six-mobile-users-targeted-by-sextortion-scams) that one in six mobile users are targeted by sextortion scams. Sextortion is a form of online blackmail where criminals threaten to share a person’s private, nude, or sexually explicit images or videos unless the victim complies with their demands—often for more sexual content, sexual favors, or money.

Having your email address included in a dataset of known Pornhub users makes you a likely target for this type of blackmail.

## How to stay safe from sextortion

Unless you used a dedicated throwaway email address to sign up for Pornhub Premium, you should be prepared to receive a sextortion-type email. If one arrives:

* Any message referencing your Pornhub use, searches, or payment should be treated as an attempt to exploit breached or previously leaked data.
* Never provide passwords or payment information by email. Pornhub has stated it will not ask for these.
* Do not respond to blackmail emails. Ignore demands, do not pay, and do not reply—responding confirms your address is actively monitored.
* Save extortion emails, including headers, content, timestamps, and attachments, but do not open links or files. This information can support reports to your email provider, local law enforcement, or cybercrime units.
* Change your Pornhub password (if your accoun...
