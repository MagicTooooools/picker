As 2025 winds down and cruises into the holiday season, it’s a good time to take a look back and reflect on what took place in the cybersecurity industry. The members of this community know that while every year is not the same, there are trends that tend to stick with us from year to year, making it important to remember what happened so we are ready for what will take place in the coming months.

With that noted, Stroz Friedberg, which is now part of LevelBlue, compiled a report noting how in 2025 threat actors utilized sophisticated social engineering techniques and exploited critical vulnerabilities to target organizations across the United States.

We identified a series of coordinated campaigns and trends throughout the year involving threat actor groups such as Luna Moth and Akira.

These groups leveraged a combination of phishing, impersonation, and exploitation of remote access tools and vulnerabilities. Campaigns often began with a convincing social engineering scheme, such as fake IT support calls or an external sender accessing an internal communication channel, resulting in the deployment of remote access tools, malware, and, at times, ransomware.

The most frequently exploited vulnerabilities observed this year involved network devices and VPN gateways, with attackers consistently seeking to bypass authentication and gain persistent access.
