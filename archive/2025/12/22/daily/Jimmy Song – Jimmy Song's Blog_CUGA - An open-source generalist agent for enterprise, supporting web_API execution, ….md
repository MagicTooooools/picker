## Detailed Introduction

CUGA is an open-source generalist agent framework designed to provide a composable, auditable runtime and toolchain for enterprise scenarios. The project supports executing complex tasks on the web and via APIs, integrates with OpenAPI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), offers multiple reasoning and decision modes, and includes policy-aware controls for deployment in governed environments.

## Main Features

* Enterprise execution: supports end-to-end tasks across web/HTTP and third-party APIs.
* Composable architecture: modular components and plugins for easy integration of custom capabilities and workflows.
* OpenAPI / MCP integrations: built-in adapters to simplify tool invocation and capability extension.
* Policy-aware: supports policy and permission controls for compliance and risk management.

## Use Cases

CUGA is suitable for enterprise-grade agent use cases such as automated business process orchestration, controlled data retrieval and processing pipelines, task-oriented customer support agents, and automated services that require policy and auditability.

## Technical Features

Implemented primarily in Python, the project focuses on extensibility and observability, providing SDKs and runtime components, multiple reasoning modes, and adapters for external models to ease incremental adoption within enterprise systems.
