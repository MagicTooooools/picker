# LevelBlue's Epic 2025: A Year of Acquisitions and Filling Our Trophy Case

![](https://levelblue.com/hubfs/Blogs/Trustwave_Blog/Headers/LB-Epic-2025.jpg)

December 22, 2025
1 Minute Read

As 2025 comes to a close, it’s the perfect time to look back at the last year to see what LevelBlue as a company accomplished.

We can point to the thousands of clients that we helped keep secure, more than a few acquisitions that have resulted in the creation of LevelBlue as the world’s largest pure-play [MSSP](/services/managed-security-services/) company and pulling it all together are the accolades from industry analyst firms and the media showing the extent and depth of our expertise.

Breaking down the 2025 awards and industry accolades requires a bit of an explanation.
As you know, the December 2025 version of LevelBlue is an entirely new entity compared to just one year ago. In July, we reported the acquisition of [Trustwave](/newsroom/press-releases/levelblue-completes-acquisition-of-trustwave-to-form-the-worlds-largest-managed-security-services-provider) and [Aon’s Cybersecurity](https://www.aon.com/en/about) and Intellectual Property Litigation consulting groups, which include cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg and Elysium Digital. Then in December we announced that our offer to acquire [Cybereason](/newsroom/press-releases/levelblue-completes-acquisition-of-cybereason-expanding-global-leadership-in-managed-detection-and-response-xdr-and-incident-response/) closed.

So, with that noted, let’s take a quick glance back at what each element of the new LevelBlue accomplished in 2025.
