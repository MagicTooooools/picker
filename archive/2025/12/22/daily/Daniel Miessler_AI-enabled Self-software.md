# AI-enabled Self-software

People are building their own software instead of paying for imperfect apps

One of the biggest changes that AI brought in 2025 is something that not enough people are talking about.

Lots of people who used to pay for software like workout apps, or analytics software, or whatever, are just writing a better version for themselves.

We used to have to pick between not having anything or paying a bunch of money for something that wasn't quite right.

A big part of that was wishing you could have this feature from that app and this feature from this app, and also have it be free.

Which was impossible.

And now people can just literally make their own app that has all the features and doesn't cost them anything.

## The creative unlock [​](#the-creative-unlock)

This is super exciting for multiple reasons.

First, they could actually sell that app since it's their opinionated version of a better offering.

But the bigger impact is that **people's creativity is being unlocked in a way that's never been possible**.

We've never been able as a species to imagine something into existence.

And this whole thing is just beginning.
