Cyber threats last week showed how attackers no longer need big hacks to cause big damage. They're going after the everyday tools we trust most — firewalls, browser add-ons, and even smart TVs — turning small cracks into serious breaches.

The real danger now isn't just one major attack, but hundreds of quiet ones using the software and devices already inside our networks. Each trusted system can become an entry point if it's left unpatched or overlooked.

Here's a clear look at the week's biggest risks, from exploited network flaws to new global campaigns and fast-moving vulnerabilities.

## **⚡ Threat of the Week**

**Flaws in Multiple Network Security Products Come Under Attack** — Over the past week, [Fortinet](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fortinet-fortigate-under-active-attack.html), [SonicWall](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/sonicwall-fixes-actively-exploited-cve.html), [Cisco](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/cisco-warns-of-active-attacks.html), and [WatchGuard](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/watchguard-warns-of-active-exploitation.html) said vulnerabilities in their products have been exploited by threat actors in real-world attacks. Cisco said attacks exploiting CVE-2025-20393, a critical flaw in AsyncOS, have been abused by a China-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor codenamed UAT-9686 to deliver malware such as ReverseSSH (aka AquaTunnel), Chisel, AquaPurge, and AquaShell. The flaw remains unpatched. SonicWall said attacks exploiting CVE-2025-40602, a local privilege escalation flaw impacting Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances, have been observed in connection with CVE-2025-23006 (CVSS score 9.8) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. The development comes as firewalls and edge appliances have become a favorite target for attackers, giving attackers deeper visibility into traffic, VPN connections, and downstream systems.

## **🔔 Top News**

* **[Featured Chrome Extension Caught Harvesting AI Chats](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/featured-chrome-browser-extension.html)** — Urban VPN Proxy, a Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension, with more than 7.3 installations, was observed stealthily gathering every prompt entered by users into artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots like OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Meta AI, and Perplexity. Three other extensions from the same developer, 1ClickVPN Proxy, Urban Browser Guard, and Urban Ad Blocker, were also updated with similar functionality. Collectively, these add-ons were installed more than eight million times. The extensions are no longer available for download from the Chrome Web Store.
* **[Ink Dragon Targets Governments with ShadowPad and FINALDRAFT](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/china-linked-ink-dragon-hacks.html)** — The threat actor known as Jewelbug (CL-STA-0049, Earth Alux, Ink Dragon, and REF7707) has been increasingly focusing on government targets in Europe since July 2025, even as it continues to attack entities located in Southeast Asia and South America. The campaign has "impacted several dozen victims, including government entities and telecommunications organizations, across Europe, Asia, and Africa." Ink Dragon does not merely use victims for data theft but actively repurposes them to support ongoing operations against other targets of interest. This creates a self-sustaining infrastructure that obscures the true origin of the attacks while maximizing the utility of every compromised asset.
* **[Kimwolf Botnet Hijacks 1.8 Million Android TVs](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/kimwolf-botnet-hijacks-18-million.html)** — A new botnet named Kimwolf is powered by no less than 1.8 million Android TVs. Infections are scattered globally, with Brazil, India, the U.S., Argentina, South Africa, and the Philippines registering higher concentrations. Kimwolf is believed to share its origins with AISURU, which has been behind some of the record-breaking DDoS attacks over the past year. It's suspected that the attackers reused code from AISURU in the early stages, before opting to develop the Kimwolf botnet to evade detection. QiAnXin XLab said it's possible some of these attacks may not have come from AISURU alone, and that Kimwolf may be either participating or even leading the efforts.
* **[LongNosedGoblin Uses Group Policy For Malware Deployment](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/china-aligned-threat-group-uses-windows.html)** — A previously undocumented China-aligned threat cluster dubbed LongNosedGoblin has been attributed to a series of cyber attacks targeting governmental entities in Southeast Asia and Japan. Central to the group's tradecraft is the abuse of Group Policy to deploy malware across the compromised network and cloud services for communication with infected endpoints using a backdoor dubbed NosyDoor. The threat actor is believed to be active s...
