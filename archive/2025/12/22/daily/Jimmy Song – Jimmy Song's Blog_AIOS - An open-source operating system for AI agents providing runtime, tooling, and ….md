## Detailed Introduction

AIOS is an open-source operating system for AI agents, designed to provide a unified runtime and tooling for building, running, and orchestrating autonomous agents. The project covers lifecycle management, plugin-based integrations, message and task orchestration, and connectors to external models and retrieval services, enabling developers to assemble reusable agent-based solutions.

## Main Features

* Modular runtime: pluggable executors and schedulers for flexible scaling and extension.
* Tools & adapters: built-in connectors for common models, retrieval, and caching to simplify RAG and external capability integration.
* Workflow orchestration: support for multi-step tasks and concurrent subtask scheduling with state management.
* Observability & debugging: logging, metrics, and tracing integrations for diagnosing agent behaviors and performance.

## Use Cases

AIOS is suitable for building agent applications that require multi-step decision making, external tool invocation, or long-term memory, such as enterprise automation assistants, domain-specific knowledge agents, automated operations and monitoring agents, and agent-driven orchestration pipelines.

## Technical Features

AIOS follows a lightweight runtime architecture emphasizing modularity and compatibility with external services; it offers SDKs and a CLI to accelerate integration and deployment. The project is released as open source to encourage community contributions and ecosystem growth.
