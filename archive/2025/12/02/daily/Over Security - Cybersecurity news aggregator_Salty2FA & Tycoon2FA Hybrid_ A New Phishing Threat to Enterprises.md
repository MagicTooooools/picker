Salty2FA & Tycoon2FA Hybrid: A New Phishing Threat to Enterprises

 Phishing kits usually have distinct signatures in their delivery methods, infrastructure, and client-side code, which makes attribution fairly predictable. But recent samples began showing traits from two different kits at once, blurring those distinctions.

That’s exactly what [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=Salty2fa_Tycoon2fa_hybrid_phishing_2025&utm_term=021225&utm_content=linktolanding) analysts saw with Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA: a sudden drop in Salty activity, the appearance of Tycoon indicators inside Salty-linked chains, and eventually single payloads carrying code from both frameworks. This overlap marks a meaningful shift; one that weakens kit-specific rules, complicates attribution, and gives threat actors more room to slip past early detection.

Let’s examine how this hybrid emerged, why it signals a shift in 2FA phishing, and what measures defenders should take in response.

## Key Takeaways

* **Salty2FA activity collapsed abruptly in late October 2025**, dropping from hundreds of weekly uploads to [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=Salty2fa_Tycoon2fa_hybrid_phishing_2025&utm_term=021225&utm_content=linksandboxlanding) to just a few dozen.

* **New samples began showing overlapping indicators from both Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA**, including shared IOCs, TTPs, and detection rule triggers.

* **Code-level analysis confirmed hybrid payloads**: early stages matched Salty2FA, while later stages reproduced Tycoon2FA’s execution chain almost line-for-line.

* **Salty2FA infrastructure showed signs of operational failure**, forcing samples to fall back to Tycoon-based hosting and payload delivery.

* The overlap aligns with earlier hypotheses suggesting a **possible connection to Storm-1747**, who are known operators of Tycoon2FA.

* **Attribution remains essential**: Distinguishing between these “2FA” phishing kits helps analysts maintain accurate hunting hypotheses and track operator behavior.

* **Defenders should update detection logic** to account for scenarios where Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA appear within the same campaign or even a single payload.

* **More cross-kit overlap is likely**, meaning future phishing campaigns may blend infrastructures, payloads, and TTPs across frameworks.

## Part 1: Numbers Don’t Lie – A Sudden Drop in Salty2FA Activity

It all started around the end of October 2025, when the number of [the ANY.RUN sandbox submissions](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=Salty2fa_Tycoon2fa_hybrid_phishing_2025&utm_term=021225&utm_content=linktoservice) showing activity linked to Salty2FA dropped sharply compared to previous periods.

Weekly phishing reports (see the [company’s X posts](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Aanyrun_app%20%22Phishing%20activity%20in%20the%20past%207%20days%22&src=typed_query&f=live)) show that, despite the usual fluctuations in overall upload volume, the average number of Salty2FA-related analysis sessions consistently stayed in the range of several hundred per week.

However, once November began, the decline became dramatic: By [November 11, 2025](https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1988139884796600506), Salty2FA had fallen to the bottom of the weekly threat rankings, with only **51 submissions**, compared to its typical **250+ per week**.

Along with indicators of compromise (IOCs) and hunting rules, the ANY.RUN sandbox’s **network block** previously triggered a near-constant alert tied to Salty-specific HTTP activity.
