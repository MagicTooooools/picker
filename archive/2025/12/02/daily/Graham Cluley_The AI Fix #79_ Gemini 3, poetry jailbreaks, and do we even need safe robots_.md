In episode 79 of The AI Fix, Gemini 3 roasts the competition, scares Nvidia, and can’t remember what year it is. Meanwhile, Graham investigates a fight between a fridge and robot, and Mark discovers that poetry could be a universal jailbreak for LLMs.

Also in this episode, our hosts ponder whether Mark Zuckerberg’s underground bunker will be keeping robots in or out, Olaf the snowman walks and talks, Disney makes a robot Graham likes, and an AI-powered teddy bear talks to kids about BDSM and arson.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of “The AI Fix” podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
