# PowerRAG

An open-source platform based on RAGFlow that extends document processing, hybrid retrieval, and evaluation-feedback capabilities.

Author:

Since:
2025-11-14

[GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/powerrag)

## Detailed Introduction

PowerRAG (Community Edition) is an open-source platform built on top of RAGFlow, designed to provide an integrated data service engine for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. While preserving RAGFlow compatibility, PowerRAG extends capabilities in document processing, structured information extraction, evaluation and feedback loops, enabling teams to build observable and optimisable LLM-powered QA, extraction, and generation systems.

## Main Features

Key capabilities that make PowerRAG suitable for engineering RAG applications:

* Multi-engine document processing: integrates MinerU and Dots.OCR and supports multiple chunking strategies to improve retrieval granularity.
* Hybrid retrieval: combines vector and full-text indexes and enables scalar filtering (numeric, temporal, categorical) for precise ranking.
* Structured extraction: uses LangExtract-based pipelines to extract tables, fields and entities from documents.
* Evaluation & feedback: integrates observability and evaluation components (Langfuse integration) to measure and iterate on model effectiveness.

## Use Cases

PowerRAG is suitable for enterprise knowledge QA, contract and report extraction, domain-specific document search, and production evaluation pipelines for LLM applications.

## Technical Features

PowerRAG leverages OceanBase’s multi-modal integrated database (SQL + NoSQL) for unified data access, hybrid index queries, and scalable storage. The system emphasises modular APIs, observability, and support for containerized deployment with Docker Compose.
