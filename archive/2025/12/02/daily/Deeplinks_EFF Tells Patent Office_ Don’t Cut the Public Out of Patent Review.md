EFF has submitted its [formal comment](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-uspto-proposed-rule-changes-filed-dec-1-2025) to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) opposing [a set of proposed rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/10/17/2025-19580/revision-to-rules-of-practice-before-the-patent-trial-and-appeal-board) that would sharply restrict the public’s ability to challenge wrongly granted patents.

[Tell USPTO: The public has a right to challenge bad patents](https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001)

Sample comment:

> I oppose the USPTO’s proposed rule changes for inter partes review (IPR), Docket No. PTO-P-2025-0025. The IPR process must remain open and fair. Patent challenges should be decided on their merits, not shut out because of legal activity elsewhere. These rules would make it nearly impossible for the public to challenge bad patents, and that will harm innovation and everyday technology users.

### **IPR Is Already Under Siege, And These Rules Would Make It Worse**
