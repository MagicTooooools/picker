# Air fryer app caught asking for voice data (re-air) (Lock and Code S06E24)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast*…

It’s often said online that if a product is free, you’re the product, but what if that bargain was no longer true? What if, depending on the device you paid hard-earned money for, you *still* became a product yourself, to be measured, anonymized, collated, shared, or sold, often away from view?

In 2024, a consumer rights group out of the UK teased this new reality when it published research into whether people’s air fryers—seriously–[might be spying on them](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/air-fryers-are-the-latest-surveillance-threat-you-didnt-consider).

By analyzing the associated [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) apps for three separate air fryer models from three different companies, researchers learned that these kitchen devices didn’t just promise to make crispier mozzarella sticks, crunchier chicken wings, and flakier reheated pastries—they also wanted a lot of user data, from precise location to voice recordings from a user’s phone.

As the researchers wrote:

> “In the air fryer category, as well as knowing customers’ precise location, all three products wanted permission to record audio on the user’s phone, for no specified reason.”

Bizarrely, these types of data requests are far from rare.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, we revisit a 2024 episode in which host David Ruiz tells three separate stories about consumer devices that somewhat invisibly collected user data and then spread it in unexpected ways. This includes kitchen utilities that sent data to China, a smart ring maker that published de-identified, aggregate data about the stress levels of its users, and a smart vacuum that recorded a sensitive image of a woman that was later shared on Facebook.

These stories aren’t about mass government surveillance, and they’re not about spying, or the targeting of political dissidents. Their intrigue is elsewhere, in how common it is for what we say, where we go, and how we feel, to be collected and analyzed in ways we never anticipated.

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
