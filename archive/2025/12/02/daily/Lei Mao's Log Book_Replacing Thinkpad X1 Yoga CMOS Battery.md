# Replacing Thinkpad X1 Yoga CMOS Battery

## Introduction

I purchased a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd Generation back in 2018, which has a 2K IPS touchscreen, 16GB RAM, and 1TB NVMe SSD. Later, because I got a personal desktop computer, I don’t have to use this laptop very much anymore. However, I still use it occasionally when I travel, because it is still a very capable laptop in 2025.

A few years ago, I noticed that when my Thinkpad X1 Yoga was out of battery, it would require me to set the date and time in BIOS every time I powered it on. This is a classic symptom of a dead CMOS battery.

In this blog post, I would like to quickly share my experience replacing the CMOS battery in my Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen.

## Replacing Thinkpad X1 Yoga CMOS Battery

It seems that the CMOS battery problem in Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen is very common, there is already a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trOQuGFAbdk) on YouTube about how to replace the CMOS battery exactly for this laptop model.

Thinkpad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen uses a CR2016 coin cell battery for CMOS. But even if I got a new CR2016 battery, I still needed wrap it with some tape which I don’t have and secure it in the battery holder. So I decided to just buy a [CMOS battery replacement kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTQXCH55) on Amazon, which includes a CR2016 battery with the tape and sticker already attached.

After replacing the CMOS battery, I powered on the laptop and entered BIOS to set the date and time. After saving and exiting BIOS, I powered off the laptop and then powered it on again. This time, the date and time were retained correctly, indicating that the CMOS battery replacement was successful.
