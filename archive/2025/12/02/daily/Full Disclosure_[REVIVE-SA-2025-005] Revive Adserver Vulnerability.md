Description
-----------
```

HackerOne community member Kassem S. (kassem\_s94) has reported that
username handling in Revive Adserver was still vulnerable to
impersonation attacks after the fix for CVE-2025-52672, via several
alternate techniques. Homoglyphs based impersonation has been
independently reported by other HackerOne community members, such as
itz\_hari\_ and khoof.

```
Details
-------
```

Username validation was historically allowing full UTF-8 usernames. That
was supposed to be a feature, but it could be used maliciously to
generate usernames visually identical to existing ones, using various
techniques, such as homoglyph characters, zero-width spaces, RTL
override, and potentially others. An attacker with user creation
permissions could specifically craft a username and trick an
administrator user to grant other permissions to it rather than the
legitimate user.

```

```

Following the report, now only usernames with a limited character set
(variant of POSIX.1-2017) are allowed.

```

========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
```

We recommend updating to the most recent 6.0.4 version of Revive
Adserver, or whatever happens to be the current release at the time of
reading this security advisory.
