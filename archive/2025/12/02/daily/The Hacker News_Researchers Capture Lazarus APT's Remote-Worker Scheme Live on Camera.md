[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhI7iqT0Bhea1lAfLcWDV9wdSMUF0e52uuWuaAYhgPboMKaSB_lC85jky5JWFRVCNc9X82mFfqDT8WeB0d9J2WCe6jM6fVswAMJZytpPlTVcvBOzRLAosqZV8ld6QTAEz4LedSA_x3J9jqigF7Di_tF-utWG7jQbVdy_eCjkVeeTMYMCX_AHWL1UhrOEkY/s790-rw-e365/korean.jpg)

A joint investigation led by Mauro Eldritch, founder of **[BCA LTD](https://bca.ltd)**, conducted together with threat-intel initiative **[NorthScan](https://northscan.co/)** and **[ANY.RUN](https://any.run),** a solution for interactive malware analysis and threat intelligence, has uncovered one of North Korea's most persistent infiltration schemes: a network of remote IT workers tied to Lazarus Group's Famous Chollima division.

For the first time, researchers managed to watch the operators work **live**, capturing their activity on what they believed were real developer laptops. The machines, however, were fully controlled, long-running sandbox environments created by ANY.RUN.

## The Setup: Get Recruited, Then Let Them In

| Screenshot of a recruiter message offering a fake job opportunity |

The operation began when NorthScan's **Heiner García** impersonated a U.S. developer targeted by a Lazarus recruiter using the alias "Aaron" (also known as "Blaze").

Posing as a job-placement "business," Blaze attempted to hire the fake developer as a frontman; a known Chollima tactic used to slip North Korean IT workers into Western companies, mainly in the **finance, crypto, healthcare, and engineering** sectors.

| The process of interviews |

The scheme followed a familiar pattern:

* steal or borrow an identity,
* pass interviews with AI tools and shared answers,
* work remotely via the victim's laptop,
* funnel salary back to DPRK.

Once Blaze asked for full access, including SSN, ID, LinkedIn, Gmail, and 24/7 laptop availability, the team moved to phase two.

## The Trap: A "Laptop Farm" That Wasn't Real

| A safe virtual environment provided by ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox |

Instead of using a real laptop, BCA LTD's Mauro Eldritch deployed the ANY.RUN Sandbox's virtual machines, each configured to resemble a fully active personal workstation with usage history, developer tools, and U.S. residential proxy routing.

The team could also force crashes, throttle connectivity, and snapshot every move without alerting the operators.

## What They Found Inside the Famous Chollima's Toolkit

The sandbox sessions exposed a lean but effective toolset built for identity takeover and remote access rather than malware deployment. Once their Chrome profile synced, the operators loaded:

* **AI-driven job automation tools** (Simplify Copilot, AiApply, Final Round AI) to auto-fill applications and generate interview answers.
* **Browser-based OTP generators** (OTP.ee / Authenticator.cc) for handling victims' 2FA once identity documents were collected.
* **Google Remote Desktop**, configured via PowerShell with a fixed PIN, providing persistent control of the host.
* Routine **system reconnaissance** (dxdiag, systeminfo, whoami) to validate the hardware and environment.
* Connections consistently routed through **Astrill VPN**, a pattern tied to previous Lazarus infrastructure.

In one session, the operator even left a Notepad message asking the "developer" to upload their ID, SSN, and banking details, confirming the operation's goal: full identity and workstation takeover without deploying a single piece of malware.

## A Warning for Companies and Hiring Teams

Remote hiring has become a quiet but reliable entry point for identity-based threats. Attackers often reach your organization by targeting individual employees with seemingly legitimate interview requests. Once they're inside, the risk goes far beyond a single compromised worker. An infiltrator can gain access to internal dashboards, sensitive business data, and manager-level accounts that carry real operational impact.

Raising awareness inside the company and giving teams a safe place to check anything suspicious can be the difference between stopping an approach early and dealing with a full-blown internal compromise later.
