# “Sleeper” browser extensions woke up as spyware on 4 million devices

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 2, 2025

![Chrome and Edge logos displayed side by side](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Chrome-and-Edge.png?w=1200)

[Researchers](https://www.koi.ai/blog/4-million-browsers-infected-inside-shadypanda-7-year-malware-campaign) have unraveled a malware campaign that really did play the long game. After seven years of behaving normally, a set of browser extensions installed on roughly 4.3 million Chrome and Edge users’ devices suddenly went rogue. Now they can track what you browse and run malicious code inside your browser.

The researchers found five extensions that operated cleanly for years before being weaponized in mid-2024. The developers earned trust, built up millions of installs, and even collected “Featured” or “Verified” status in the Chrome and Edge stores. Then they pushed silent updates that turned these add-ons into spyware and malware.

The extensions turned into a remote code execution framework. They could download and run malicious JavaScript inside the browser and collect information about visited sites and the user’s browser, sending it all back to attackers believed to be based in China.

One of the most prevalent of these extensions is WeTab, with around three million installs on Edge. It acts as spyware by streaming visited URLs, search queries, and other data in real time. The researchers note that while Google has removed the extensions, the Edge store versions are still available.

Playing the long game is not something cybercriminals usually have the time or patience for.

The researchers attributed the campaign to the ShadyPanda group, which has been active since at least 2018 and launched their first campaign in 2023. That was a simpler case of affiliate fraud, inserting affiliate tracking codes into users’ shopping clicks.

What the group did learn from that campaign was that they could get away with deploying malicious updates to existing extensions. Google vets new extensions carefully, but updates don’t get the same attention.

It’s [not the first time](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/millions-of-people-spied-on-by-malicious-browser-extensions-in-chrome-and-edge) we’ve seen this behavior, but waiting for years is exceptional. When an extension has been available in the web store for a while, cybercriminals can insert malicious code through updates to the extension. Some researchers refer to the clean extensions as “sleeper agents” that sit quietly for years before switching to malicious behavior.

This new campaign is far more dangerous. Every infected browser runs a remote code execution framework. Every hour, it checks `api.extensionplay[.]com` for new instructions, downloads arbitrary JavaScript, and executes it with full browser API access.

## How to find malicious extensions manually

The researchers at Koi shared a [long list of Chrome and Edge extension IDs](https://www.koi.ai/blog/4-million-browsers-infected-inside-shadypanda-7-year-malware-campaign#heading-7) linked to this campaign. You can check if you have these extensions in your browser:

**In Chrome**

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. In the address bar at the top, type **chrome://extensions/** and press **Enter**.​ This opens the Extensions page, which shows all extensions installed in your browser.​
3. At the top right of this page, turn on **Developer mode**.
4. Now each extension card will show an extra line with its **ID.**​
5. Press **C...
