# RAM Forensics: Tools, Techniques, and Best Practices

![](/images/blog/memory-forensics-cover.png)

Some of the most valuable evidence in digital forensics and cyber incident response investigations never touches the disk. It exists only in Random Access Memory (RAM), the computer's high-speed working space where active processes, decrypted data, and live system state reside. This data can be captured and analyzed with memory forensics tools, revealing information about open applications, executed commands, viewed documents, and more.

RAM forensics is particularly indispensable during cyber incidents. It enables investigators to reconstruct attacker activity, detect fileless or injected malware, and gain a detailed view of system state at the moment of compromise—evidence that often exists nowhere else.

This article covers the essential elements of RAM forensics, including the types of data that can be extracted, how to acquire memory safely, and how to analyze RAM images effectively:

* [The basics of RAM forensics](#basics)
* [RAM acquisition with Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer](#ram-acquisition)
* [Approach to RAM analysis in Belkasoft X](#approach-to-ram-analysis)
* [Analyzing a RAM dump in Belkasoft X](#analyzing-ram-dump)
* [Examining RAM artifacts](#examining-ram-artifacts)

As adversaries become more sophisticated, RAM forensics has evolved from a specialized field to a fundamental part of a solid [cybersecurity incident response plan](/incident-response-workflow-template). Continue reading to learn practical memory forensics techniques and tips for examining volatile memory with [Belkasoft X](/x).

## The basics of RAM forensics

RAM is the short-term working memory of a computer. It temporarily stores operating system services, running applications, and data that the system needs to access quickly. This data is volatile: it constantly changes and ultimately disappears when the computer is powered off. That is why, during a cyber incident or criminal investigation, it is critical to acquire a RAM image while the system is live, and as soon as possible—before relevant volatile data gets overwritten.

A memory snapshot, or RAM dump, can reveal evidence not available on disk, such as running processes, network connections, browser traces, active chats, cloud application data, injected code, malware, rootkits, passwords, and encryption keys.

Besides live RAM, you can find memory artifacts in the following locations:

* **Hibernation files:** hiberfil.sys can contain parts of memory saved when the system hibernates
* **Page files:** pagefile.sys can hold swapped memory pages

These files reside on the disk. They can help recover volatile evidence from earlier activities or, when live memory acquisition is not possible, serve as the primary source of memory artifacts.

The RAM forensics process typically involves two stages: acquisition and analysis. Each stage relies on specialized tools, techniques, and best practices.

### RAM acquisition

Live memory acquisition often requires kernel-mode tools like [Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer](/ram-capturer). Such tools operate at the highest privilege level of the operating system, granting unrestricted access to all physical memory, including protected areas. Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer is designed for Windows-based computers. To acquire RAM contents from other platforms, you can use tools like LiME for Linux and OSXPmem for macOS. During acquisition:

* **Avoid launching new applications**: New processes may overwrite volatile memory and change the state you intend to capture.
* **Run acquisition from external media:** Running the acquisition tool from a storage device that cannot write to the target system prevents unintentional modifications to system files, logs, and memory.
* **Capture full memory when possible**: A raw image, such as the .raw or .mem format, preserves the original RAM structure and maintains compatibility with common forensic tools.

### RAM analysis

A memory dump file looks like a big raw binary blob with seemingly random hex values and unreadable characters, which may make no sense until you analyze it with a specialized memory forensics tool. The following techniques and tools can help with memory analysis:

* **Carving**: Recover raw content from memory by scanning for known file signatures and structural patterns. Carving reveals pictures, chat remnants, [LNK files](/forensic-analysis-of-lnk-files), and other fragments that may not be visible in structure-based analysis.
* **Structure-aware analysis**: Using tools like Volatility, you can extract processes, loaded drivers, files, and other structures stored in memory. Such an analysis can help reveal persistence mechanisms, code injection, and runtime-only malicious activity.
* **Rule-based refinement**: Apply YARA rules to identify known signatures in memory. Use Sigma rules to flag significant event-log patterns.

The following sections will review each step in detail, demonstrating how Belkasoft X can help with memory forensics tasks.

## RAM acquisition with Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer

Belkasoft RAM Capturer is a free, portable tool designed to acquire RAM on Windows systems. The tool runs in kernel mode to bypass anti-dumping protections, creating forensically sound raw memory dumps (.mem format) in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. It requires no installation and has a minimal system footprint.

To obtain a machine’s memory dump using Belkasoft RAM Capturer, run it as an administrator on the target machine (preferably from a USB drive). Select an external drive as the output destinat...
