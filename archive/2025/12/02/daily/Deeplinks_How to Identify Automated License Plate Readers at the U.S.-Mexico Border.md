U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and scores of state and local law enforcement agencies have installed a massive dragnet of automated license plate readers (ALPRs) in the US-Mexico borderlands.

In many cases, the agencies have gone out of their way to disguise the cameras from public view. And the problem is only going to get worse: as recently as July 2025, CBP put out a [solicitation](https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/9ff5d1be205b4aa6882147ee3a147a56/view) to purchase 100 more covert trail cameras with license plate-capture ability.

Last month, the Associated Press published [an in-depth investigation](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-patrol-surveillance-drivers-ice-trump-9f5d05469ce8c629d6fecf32d32098cd) into how agencies have deployed these systems and exploited this data to target drivers. But what do these cameras look like? Here's a guide to identifying ALPR systems when you're driving the open road along the border.

## ALPR at Checkpoints and Land Ports of Entry

All land ports of entry have ALPR systems that collect all vehicles entering and exiting the country. They typically look like this:
