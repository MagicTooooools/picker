Technology can uplift democracy, or it can be an authoritarian weapon. EFF is making sure it stays on the side of freedom. We’re defending encryption, exposing abusive surveillance tech, fighting government overreach, and standing up for free expression. But we need your help to protect digital rights—[and right now, your donation will be matched dollar-for-dollar.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/pu--DL)

[Power up!](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/pu--DL)

Join EFF Today & Get a Free Donation Match

**It’s Power Up Your Donation Week and all online contributions get an automatic match up to $302,700**. Many thanks to the passionate EFF supporters who created this year's matching fund! The Power Up matching challenge offers a rare opportunity to double your impact on EFF’s legal, educational, advocacy, and free software work when it’s needed most. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to give—this is it.

Digital rights are human rights. Governments have silenced online speech, corporations seek to exploit our data for profit, and police are deploying dystopian tools to track our every move. But the fight is far from over, with the support of EFF’s members.

How EFF is fighting back:

* Creating tools to help people understand and protect their rights
* Holding powerful institutions accountable in court when those rights are threatened
* Pushing back against surveillance regimes through the justice system and in legislatures
* Locking arms with attorneys, technologists, and defenders of digital freedom—*including you*
