In 2024, EFF wrote our initial blog about [what could go wrong when police let AI write police reports](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports). Since then, the technology has proliferated at a disturbing rate. Why? The most popular generative AI tool for writing police reports is Axon’s Draft One, and Axon also happens to be the largest provider of body-worn cameras to police departments in the United States. As we’ve written, companies are increasingly [bundling their products](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/beware-bundle-companies-are-banking-becoming-your-police-departments-favorite) to make it easier for police to buy more technology than they may need or that the public feels comfortable with.

We have good news and bad news.

**Here’s the bad news:** AI written police reports are still unproven, untransparent, and downright irresponsible–especially when the criminal justice system, informed by police reports, is deciding people’s freedom. The King County prosecuting attorney’s office in Washington state [barred police from using AI to write police reports](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/prosecutors-washington-state-warn-police-dont-use-gen-ai-write-reports). As their [memo](https://komonews.com/amp/news/local/king-county-prosecutor-tells-police-not-to-use-ai-artificial-intelligence-for-official-reports-for-now-errors-concerns-law-enforcement-perjury-criminal-justice) read, “We do not fear advances in technology – but we do have legitimate concerns about some of the products on the market now... AI continues to develop and we are hopeful that we will reach a point in the near future where these reports can be relied on. For now, our office has made the decision not to accept any police narratives that were produced with the assistance of AI.”

In July of this year, EFF published a [two-part](https://www.eff....
