The US legal profession was just one of the pillars of American democracy that was [targeted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_law_firms_and_lawyers_under_the_second_Trump_administration) in the early days of the second Trump administration. At EFF, we were proud to publicly and loudly support the legal profession and, most importantly, continue to do our work challenging the government’s erosion of digital rights—work that became even more critical as many law firms shied away from pro bono work.

For those that don’t know: pro bono work is work that for-profit law firms undertake for the public good. This usually means providing legal counsel to clients who desperately need but cannot afford it. It’s a vital practice, since non-profits like EFF don’t have the same capacity, resources, or expertise of a classic white shoe law firm. It’s mutually beneficial, actually, since law firms and non-profits have different experience and areas of expertise that can supplement each other’s work.

A little more than a month into the new administration, President Trump [began retaliating](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/donald-trump-jack-smith-covington-lawyers-022770) against large law firms who supported had investigations against him or litigated against his interests, representing clients either challenging his policies during his first term or defending the outcome of the 2020 election among other cases. The retaliation quickly [spread](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/06/trump-security-clearance-steele-dossier-025203) [to](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/15/donald-trump-law-firm-attack-025949) [othe...
