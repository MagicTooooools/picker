The world has been forced to bear the weight of billionaires and politicians who salivate over making tech more invasive, more controlling, and more hostile. That's why EFF’s mission for your digital rights is crucial, and why your support matters more than ever. You can fuel the fight for privacy and free speech with as little as $5 or $10 a month:

[Join EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/yecr--D)

Become a Monthly Sustaining Donor

When you donate by December 31, your monthly support goes *even further* by unlocking bonus Year-End Challenge grants! With your help, EFF can receive up to seven grants that increase in size as the number of supporters grows ([check our progress on the counter](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/yecr--D)). Many thanks to EFF’s Board of Directors for creating the 2025 challenge fund.

The EFF team makes every dollar count. EFF members giving just $10 or less each month raised $400,000 for digital rights in the last year. That funds court motions, software development, educational campaigns, and investigations for the public good every day. EFF member support matters, and we need you.

## 📣 Stand Together: That’s How We Win 📣

You can help EFF hold corporations and authoritarians to account. We fight for tech users [in the courts](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/lawsuit-challenges-san-joses-warrantless-alpr-mass-surveillance) and we [lobby](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/eff-congress-heres-what-strong-privacy-law-looks) and [educate lawmakers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/trump-administrations-order-ai-deeply-misguided), all while developing free [privacy-enhancing tech](https://www.eff.org/pages/tools) and [educational](https://www.eff.org/age) [resources](https://ssd.eff.org/) so people can protect themselves now. Your monthly donation will keep us going strong in this pivotal moment.
