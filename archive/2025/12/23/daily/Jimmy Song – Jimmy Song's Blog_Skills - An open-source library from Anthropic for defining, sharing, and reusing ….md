## Detailed Introduction

Skills is an open-source library from Anthropic that provides a set of definable, shareable, and reusable capability modules for agent development. The repository includes skill examples, interface conventions, and usage guidance to help developers quickly add reusable behaviors to agents and reduce the complexity of building multi-step workflows.

## Main Features

* Standardized skill definition patterns for consistent invocation and testing.
* Example implementations and best practices for quick onboarding and reuse.
* Composable capability modules designed to be shared across different agents and workflows.

## Use Cases

Skills is suited for scenarios that require packaging common operations into reusable capabilities, such as task automation, information retrieval and processing, cross-system integration, and as building blocks in more complex agent workflows. It is particularly useful for teams aiming to modularize single-step actions and multi-step procedures.

## Technical Features

* Module-oriented skill descriptors and invocation conventions for runtime integration.
* Language-agnostic design with examples in common implementation languages for portability.
* Focus on testability and composability to enable validation within CI pipelines.
