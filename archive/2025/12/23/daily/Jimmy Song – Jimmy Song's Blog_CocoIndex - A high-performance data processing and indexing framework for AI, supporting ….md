## Detailed Introduction

CocoIndex is a data transformation and indexing framework designed for AI workloads, providing ultra-performance processing with support for incremental and real-time indexing. It focuses on pipeline-ing and normalizing raw data into formats suitable for vectorization and retrieval, accelerating semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. The project offers end-to-end processing components that balance throughput and latency for large-scale, continuously-updated indexes.

## Main Features

* High-performance data transformation and indexing with parallel and incremental processing.
* Native support for semantic indexing and vectorization pipelines to integrate with vector databases.
* Composable processor components and adapters for connecting diverse data sources and downstream systems.

## Use Cases

CocoIndex is suitable for converting massive heterogeneous data into searchable semantic indexes, such as knowledge base construction, real-time log/event indexing, document and code search, and upstream data processing for RAG pipelines. It is also well-suited for engineering applications requiring low-latency incremental indexing and continuous data synchronization.

## Technical Features

* Pipeline-oriented modular design with support for custom transformers and connectors.
* Engineered for performance and scalability using efficient concurrency and incremental computation strategies.
* Integrates with common vector databases and retrieval components, enabling CI/CD verification of data consistency and index quality.
