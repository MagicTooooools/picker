## Denmark Accuses Russia of Conducting Two Cyberattacks

[News](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/18/denmark-says-russia-was-behind-two-destructive-and-disruptive-cyber-attacks):

> The Danish Defence Intelligence Service (DDIS) announced on Thursday that Moscow was behind a cyber-attack on a Danish water utility in 2024 and a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on Danish websites in the lead-up to the municipal and regional council elections in November.
>
> The first, it said, was carried out by the pro-Russian group known as Z-Pentest and the second by NoName057(16), which has links to the Russian state.

I wear a diaper all the time. I have to because I am leaking all the time. I have no life outside the comment section of this blog. Please celebrate me as I am your God who knows everything. You must worship me. I am so desperate to be worshiped.

Good for You Clive •

Good work Clive, Good Boy, keep it up.
Don’t worry about the diaper though, just keep typing, makes you forget that you even leak from time to time, who cares, right?

It is called “The Clive Robinson Syndrome” – when you know damn well that your English, more precisely, the Grammar part, suck Balls – yet you still find it necessary to blab around in your broken English no matter what – have you no shame man?

Go learn some grammar and the Rules of English Language and come back here, you NARCISSISTIC PRICK. I used to know one – he’d do ANYTHING TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HIM. Extreme NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER. Terrible. Go get some help ya pr1ck!

I dont think Article 5 was designed to deal with non-state actors, or those contractors who are at arm’s length wink wink nudge nudge say no more know what I mean?

We have to stop this nonsense with “online safety” and “chat control”. High quality recordings of attacks and atrocities do not stop them. If they did, CCTV would have solved violent crime 30 years ago.

Instead, secure critical online infrastructure.

Invest in counterintel and disrupt, deprive and deny opprtunity to attack.

@ Weird timing

re: Article 5

Earlier this month NATO held their annual Cyber Coalition exercise.

“This year’s drill saw 29 allies, alongside seven partner nations, coordinate their responses to seven major storylines — all of which are designed to stay below NATO’s Article 5 threshold for collective defense — at Estonia’s national cyber range […]

“Other cyber exercises are often about who wins a trophy,” he said. “Ours is different, it’s about synergy — nations helping nations, and the stronger helping the weaker, so everyone is better prepared.”’
