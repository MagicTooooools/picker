As 2025 closes and we look toward 2026, the cybersecurity industry is bracing for radical changes that go beyond just intensifying existing problems.

To help prepare for these new challenges, at least as much as is possible, a few of our experts weigh in on the defining shifts across the security landscape, from the evolution of nation-state tactics and the crisis in core internet infrastructure to the necessary, strategic pivot toward cyber resilience and identity-centric defenses like Zero Trust.

**Evolving Ransomware and Nation-State Cyber Operations**

Not getting political, but the US is not making a lot of new friends, and our isolationist and nation-snubbing political stance is causing global frustration.

Countries that may have otherwise been an ally or at least help prevent attacks against their “friends” may focus on new bonds. As such, ransomware, extortion, disruptors, or destroyer exploits and targeting will increase.

Traditional powerhouses like Russia and China may conduct stealthy edge-device attacks, intensify cyberwarfare, and blur more lines between hacktivism and espionage as our government causes more reductions in regulations, breaks continuity of knowledge in enforcement and investigative entities, and raises the tone of hostility across the globe, which can increase the threats and vulnerabilities of US cyber posture and corporate preparedness.
