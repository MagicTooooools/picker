Threat: HEUR.Backdoor.Win32.Poison.gen
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Description: The malware looks for and executes a x32-bit
"WININET.dll" PE file in its current directory. Therefore, we can
hijack the DLL and execute our own code to intercept and terminate the
malware. Leverage RansomLordNG v1.0 for DLL generation, while written
as a proof-of-concept to specifically defeat ransomware, these DLLs
may also defeat other types of malware if vulnerable. All basic tests
were conducted successfully in a virtual machine environment.
RansomLordNG v1.0 currently includes enhanced logging, memory dump and
deweaponize features.
Family: Poison
Type: PE32
Attack-pattern TTP: Hijack Execution Flow (T1574)
MD5: b2e50fa38510a5ea8e11f614b1c1d0d5
SHA256: 0de336f07cc19a6fda4cf9dacf1c4be0c6fb17158182d5274355cffa494ac8ed
Vuln ID: MVID-2025-0701
Disclosure: 12/20/2025
Exploit/PoC:
1) Download RansomLordNG v1.0
    https://github.com/malvuln/RansomLord
2) Locate the x32 WININET.dll entry using the -m flag (DLL Map)
3) Use -g flag (Generate Exploit) to output an DLL, based on an
existing vulnerable malware in the victims list.
4) (Optional) -e flag to setup Windows event IOC logging in the
registry, this will log the SHA256 hash, full path and filename.
