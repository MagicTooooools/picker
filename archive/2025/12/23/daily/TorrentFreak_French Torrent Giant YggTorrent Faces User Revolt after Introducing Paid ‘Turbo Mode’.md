# French Torrent Giant YggTorrent Faces User Revolt after Introducing Paid ‘Turbo Mode’

YggTorrent, the largest francophone torrent community, faces widespread pushback after it introduced a paid 'Turbo Mode' for €86 this week. For regular users, the tracker now has a limit of five torrent downloads per day and a 30-second download delay. According to the site's operators, these restrictions are needed to deter bots and ban hit-and-run downloads.

The torrent site is not a typical torrent indexer. The community is powered by a dedicated tracker, something that’s quite rare these days.

Last year, [YggTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YggTorrent) made [registrations mandatory](https://torrentfreak.com/french-torrent-giant-yggtorrent-goes-private-240517/) in a bid to keep anti-piracy agencies at bay. But today, the tracker is facing internal struggles rather than external blockades after it introduced a controversial policy change.

## Ygg Launches Paid ‘Turbo Mode’

Shortly before Christmas, YggTorrent introduced a new tier called ‘Turbo Mode,’ where users can enjoy unrestricted access for a lifetime fee of €86. Effectively, this means that people now have to pay to enjoy the regular experience.

Put differently, non-paying users will be downgraded to a lower tier where they can download a maximum of five torrents per day. These torrents can be downloaded after a 30-second countdown timer.

According to YggTorrent’s staff, these changes are needed to guarantee that the site will continue to run smoothly.

“This measure addresses a significant increase in bots, ghost leeching, and ‘hit-and-run’ behavior. The tracker currently manages millions of peers, a significant portion of which are automated,” Ygg’s moderator writes.

## Users and Uploaders Revolt

Understandably, YggTorrent’s users were [not pleased by this announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/yggTorrents/). The controversy reached a boiling point when Team\_QTZ, a release group with years of experience and over 3,300 high-quality torrents, publicly revolted against the new policy.

Team\_QTZ [accused](https://torrentfreak.com/images/team-qzt.jpg) YggTorrent’s administration of trying to profit off the backs of uploaders. They saw this ‘Turbo Mode’ move as the final straw and called for a site-wide strike, urging others to stop seeding too.

The French news site Numerama [reports that](https://www.numerama.com/tech/2147875-yggtorrent-en-crise-que-se-passe-t-il-sur-lannuaire-de-liens-bittorrent.html) YggTorrent’s response was uncompromising. The site swiftly removed Team\_QTZ’s message, and the entire team was banned from the platform.

The new paid tier and the harsh response to criticism fuel rumors. According to some online commenters, the recent actions reek of an exit scam in which YggTorrent might cash in before running off, but there is no evidence that that is the case.

That said, it is clear that many users are not pleased with the recent changes, with some actively looking for alternative French torrent trackers such as Sharewood or TheOldSchool.
