Are you wondering **what does restore mean for iPhone?** If you see the **“support.apple.com/iphone/restore”** message on your iPhone, it usually means your device has run into a serious problem during an update or system error.

This screen is also called the **iPhone recovery screen**. It acts as a safeguard to prevent further damage to your device. Once your iPhone enters this mode, you can’t use it normally until it’s restored or repaired.

This message is not a hardware problem; it’s your iPhone trying to protect itself. The good news is, there are several ways to fix it and get your iPhone working again.

## **Part 2: How to Fix My iPhone Stuck on the Restore Screen for Free?**

* **iPhone 6s or earlier:** Press and hold **Home + Side (or Top) button** until the Apple logo appears.

### **2. Reinstall iOS via iTunes**
