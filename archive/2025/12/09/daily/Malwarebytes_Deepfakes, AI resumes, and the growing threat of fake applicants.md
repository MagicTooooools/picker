# Deepfakes, AI resumes, and the growing threat of fake applicants

by [mverburgh](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mverburgh) |
December 9, 2025

![recruiter looking at resumes online](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/resumes.jpg?w=1200)

Recruiters expect the odd exaggerated resume, but many companies, including us here at Malwarebytes, are now dealing with something far more serious: job applicants who aren’t real people at all.

From fabricated identities to AI-generated resumes and outsourced impostor interviews, hiring pipelines have become a new way for attackers to sneak into organizations.

Fake applicants aren’t just a minor HR inconvenience anymore but a genuine security risk. So, what’s the purpose behind it, and what should you look out for?

## How these fake applicants operate

These applicants don’t just fire off a sketchy resume and hope for the best. Many use polished, coordinated tactics designed to slip through screening.

### **AI-generated resumes**

AI-generated resumes are now one of the most common signs of a fake applicant. Language models can produce polished, keyword-heavy resumes in seconds, and scammers often generate dozens of variations to see which one gets past an Applicant Tracking System. In [some cases](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3964995/job-seekers-using-genai-to-fake-skills-and-credentials.html), entire profiles are generated at the same time.

These resumes often look flawless on paper but fall apart when you ask about specific projects, timelines, or achievements. Hiring teams have reported waves of nearly identical resumes for unrelated positions, or applicants whose written materials are far more detailed than anything they can explain in conversation. Some have even received multiple resumes with the same formatting quirks, phrasing, or project descriptions.

### **Fake or borrowed identities**

Impersonation is common. Scammers use AI-generated or stolen profile photos, fake addresses, and VoIP phone numbers to look legitimate. LinkedIn activity is usually sparse, or you’ll find several nearly identical profiles using the same name with slightly different skills.

At Malwarebytes, as in [this Register article](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/11/it_worker_scam), we’ve noticed that the details applicants provide don’t always match what we see during the interview. In some cases, the same name and phone number have appeared across multiple applications, each supported by a freshly tailored resume. Further discrepancies occur in many instances where the applicant claims to be located in one country, but calls from another country entirely, usually in Asia.

### **Outsourced, scripted, and deepfake interviews**

Fraudulent interviews tend to follow a familiar pattern. Introductions are short and vague, and answers arrive after long, noticeable pauses, as if the person is being coached off-screen. Many try to keep the camera off, or ask to complete tests offline instead of live.

In more advanced cases, you might see the telltale signs of real-time filters or deepfake tools, like mismatched lip-sync, unnatural blinking, or distorted edges. Most scammers still rely on simpler tricks like camera avoidance or off-screen coaching, but there have been [reports](https://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/extra-bytes/from-application-to-infiltration-how-deepfakes-are-penetrating-the-workforce) of attackers using deepfake video or voice clones in interviews. It’s still rare, but it shows how quickly these tools are evo...
