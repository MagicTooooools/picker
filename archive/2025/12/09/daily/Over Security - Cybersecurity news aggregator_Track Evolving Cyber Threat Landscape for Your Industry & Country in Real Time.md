Track Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape for Your Industry & Country in Real Time

Effective cyber security depends on knowing which risks matter most. ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=industry_geo_threat_landscape&utm_term=091225&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) provides industry and geographic context, powered by live attack investigations from [15,000+ companies](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/), that SOC teams need to prioritize alerts, [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/enrich-iocs-with-threat-intelligence/), and threats with confidence and build their defense strategy for maximum ROI.

Here’s how.

## Challenge: Context-free TI Wastes SOC Time

Most [threat intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-for-soc/) sources return long lists of IPs, domains, and hashes, but they rarely explain how those indicators map to a specific sector or region. SOC teams end up treating every threat as equally important, spreading detection and hunting efforts thin and burning time on noise instead of the threats that actually appear in their environment.

For [MSSPs](https://any.run/mssp/?utm_source=mtt&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=industry_geo_threat_landscape&utm_term=091225&utm_content=linktomssplanding), the problem is even sharper: they serve clients from many fields at once. The lack of industry or geo context makes it hard to prioritize work and hard to prove value to clients who expect sector-aware monitoring.

## Solution: Industry & Geo Threat Landscape for Every Indicator

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image6-1024x611.png)

TI Lookup now adds an extra layer of context on top of every Premium search query. In addition to listing [IOCs, IOAs, IOBs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/iocs-iobs-ioas-explained/), and sandbox sessions, it builds a real-time snapshot of which industries and countries are most commonly associated with the threat or indicators you queried.

The functionality provides three key context fields:

| Field | Description | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk score by industry | Likelihood (%) that the queried threat/indicator is linked to attacks on each industry based on the search results. | See how likely your industry toface similar threats to prioritize defenses. |
| Threat names | How often (%) each threat appears in the current search results. | Discover the most likely threats related to your query for focused investigation and response. |
| Submission countries | How often the queried threat/indicator appears in submissions from each country based on the search results. | See where relevant threats are reported the most to uncover geographic hotspots and trends. |

TI Lookup now turns your threat landscape into a live, industry-aware radar. It shows exactly how a given threat or indicator maps to specific sectors and countries, so you see where it really matters for your business instead of drowning in generic feeds.

The threat landscape shifts. So should your SOC.
Gain industry & geo insights for focused action.

[Try TI Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=industry_geo_threat_landscape&utm_term=091225&utm_content=contactus#contact-sales)

Powered by real-time analysis of attacks on 15,000 organizations worldwide, it helps you connect threats, techniques, and affected industries, surface niche campaigns, and act before they hit your environment.

## How SOCs Use it in Daily Workflows

There are several use cases for TI Lookup’s threat landscape functionality.
