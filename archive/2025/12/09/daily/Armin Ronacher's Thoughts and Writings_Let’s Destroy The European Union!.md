# Let’s Destroy The European Union!

written on December 09, 2025

Elon Musk [is not
happy](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-threatens-response-against-individuals-who-imposed-e120m-x-penalty/)
with the EU fining his X platform and is currently on a tweet rampage
complaining about it. Among other things, he wants the whole EU to be
abolished. He sadly is hardly the first wealthy American to share their
opinions on European politics lately. I’m not a fan of this outside attention
but I believe it’s noteworthy and something to pay attention to. In particular
because the idea of destroying and ripping apart the EU is not just popular in
the US; it’s popular over here too. Something that greatly concerns me.

## We Have Genuine Problems

There is definitely a bunch of stuff we might want to fix over here. [I have
complained about our culture](/2025/10/21/eu-resigation/) before. Unfortunately,
I happen to think that our challenges are not coming from politicians or civil
servants, but from us, the people. Europeans don’t like to take risks and are
quite pessimistic about the future compared to their US counterparts.
Additionally, we Europeans have been trained to feel a lot of guilt over the
years, which makes us hesitant to stand up for ourselves. This has led to all
kinds of interesting counter-cultural movements in Europe, like years of
significant support for unregulated immigration and an unhealthy obsession with
the idea of degrowth. Today, though, neither seems quite as popular as it once
was.

Morally these things may be defensible, but in practice they have led to Europe
losing its competitive edge and eroding social cohesion. The combination of a
strong social state and high taxes in particular does not mix well with the kind
of immigration we have seen in the last decade: mostly people escaping wars
ending up in low-skilled jobs. That means it’s not unlikely that certain
classes of immigrants are going to be net-negative for a very long time, if not
forever, and increasingly society is starting to think about what the
implications of that might be.

Yet even all of that is not where our problems lie, and it’s certainly not our
presumed lack of free speech. Any conversation on that topic is foolish because
it’s too nuanced. Society clearly wants to place some limits to free speech
here, but the same is true in the US. In the US we can currently see a
significant push-back against “woke ideologies,” and a lot of that push-back
involves restricting freedom of expression through different avenues.

## America Likes a Weak Europe

The US might try to lecture Europe right now on free speech, but what it should
be lecturing us on is our economic model. Europe has too much fragmentation,
incredibly strict regulation that harms innovation, ineffective capital markets,
and a massive dependency on both the United States and China. If the US were to
cut us off from their cloud providers, we would not be able to operate anything
over here. If China were to stop shipping us chips, we would be in deep trouble
too ([we have seen
this](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/28/nexperia-crisis-dutch-chipmaker-issues-urgent-plea-to-its-china-unit.html)).

This is painful because the US is historically a great example when it comes to
freedom of information, direct democracy at the state level, and rather low
corruption. These are all areas where we’re not faring well, at least not
consistently, and we should be lectured. Fundamentally, the US approach to
capitalism is about as good as it’s going to get. If there was any doubt that
alternative approaches might have worked out better, at this point there’s very
little evidence in favor of that. Yet because of increased loss of civil
liberties in the US, many Europeans now see everything that the US is doing as
bad. A grave mistake.

Both China and the US are quite happy with the dependency we have on them and
with us falling short of our potential. Europe’s attempt at dealing with the
dependency so far has been to regulate and tax US corporations more heavily.
That’s not a good strategy. The solution must be to become competitive again so
that we can redirect that tax revenue to local companies instead. The Digital
Services Act is a good example: we’re punishing Apple and forcing them to open
up their platform, but we have no company that can take advantage of that
opening.

## Europe is Europe’s Biggest Problem

If you read my blog here, you might remember my musings about [the lack of
clarity of what a foreigner is](/2025/9/14/whats-an-foreigner/) in Europe. The
reality is that Europe has been deeply integrated for a long time now as a
result of how the EU works — but still not at the same level as the US. I think
this is still the biggest problem. People point to languages as the challenge,
but underneath the hood, the countries are still fighting each other. Austria
wants to protect its local stores from larger competition in Germany and its
carpenters from the cheaper ones coming from Slovenia. You can replace Austria
with any other EU country and you will find the same thing.

The EU might not be perfect, but it’s hard to imagine that abolishing it would
solve any problem given how national states have shown to behave. The moment
the EU fell away, we would be warming up all border struggles again. We have
already seen similar issues pop up in Northern Ireland after the UK left.

And we just have so much bureaucracy, so many non-functioning social systems,
and such a tremendous amount of incoming governmental debt to support our
flailing pension schemes. We need growth more than any other bloc, and we have
such a low probability of actually accomplishing that.

Given how the EU is structured, it’s also acting as the punching bag for the
failure of the nation states to come to agreements. It’s not that EU
bureaucrats are telling Europeans to take in immigrants, to enact chat control
or to enact cookie banners or attached plastic caps. Those are all initiatives
that come from one or more member states. But the EU in the end will always
take the blame because even local politicians that voted in support of some of
these things can easily point towards “Brussels” as having created a problem.

## The United States of Europe

A Europe in pieces does not sound appealing to me at all, and that’s because I
can look at what China and the US have.

What China and the US have that Europe lacks is a strong national identity. Both
countries have recognized that strength comes from unity. China in particular
is fighting any kind of regionalism tooth and nail. The US has accomplished
this through the pledge of allegiance, a civil war, the Department of Education
pushing a common narrative in schools, and historically putting post offices and
infrastructure everywhere. Europe has none of that. More importantly, Europeans
don’t even want it. There is a mistaken belief that we can just become these
tiny states again and be fine.

If Europe wants to be competitive, it seems unlikely that this can be
accomplished without becoming a unified superpower. Yet there is no belief in
Europe that this can or should happen, and the other superpowers have little
interest in seeing it happen either.

## What Would Fixing Actually Look Like?

If I had to propose something constructive, it would be this: Europe needs to
stop pretending it can be 27 different countries with 27 different economic
policies while also being a single market. The half-measures are killing us. We
have a common currency in the Eurozone but no common fiscal policy. We have
freedom of movement but wildly different social systems. We have common
regulations but fragmented enforcement. 27 labor laws, 27 different legal
systems, tax codes, complex VAT rules and so on.
