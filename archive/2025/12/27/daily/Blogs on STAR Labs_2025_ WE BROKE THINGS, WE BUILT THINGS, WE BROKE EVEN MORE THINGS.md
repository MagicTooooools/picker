Most will talk about the success in their year-end posts. Great. Nobody talks about the failures. Nobody talks about what ACTUALLY happened.

Well, we are going to tell you about OUR STORY - the success AND the failures. The whole thing. Because that’s how we actually learn…from our own mistakes.

So here it is, UNFILTERED. Buckle up.

## PWN2OWN 2025 BERLIN & IRELAND[#](#pwn2own-2025-berlin--ireland)

We could only bring one of our interns, Gerrard Tai, along with us to Pwn2Own. Not to watch from the sidelines, but to COMPETE. He was right there with us, building exploit chains, debugging our team members’ codes while under pressure and experiencing the absolute rush of pwning devices on the world stage.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Berlin, we walked away with our 2nd **Master of Pwn**.

In Pwn2Own 2025 Ireland, we managed to pwn 2 devices along with many interns. We nearly got 3 entries if you [read this](https://starlabs.sg/blog/2025/11-breaking-into-a-brother-mfc-j1010dw/).

When the exploits succeeded, some of us ugly cried internally. No shame about that.

## OFF-BY-ONE CONFERENCE: ROUND 2, FIGHT![#](#off-by-one-conference-round-2-fight)

Around 300 people showed up for our 2nd Edition of [Off-By-One](https://offbyone.sg/):

* Probably **Southeast Asia’s FIRST speedrun CTF** (massive thanks to Riatre, Yudai Fujiwara and Li Jiantao for making this absolutely wild CTF)
* **Smart weighing machine hacking** by Eugene Lim (your bathroom scale has secrets)
* **Lockpick contest** by Locksports SG
* **CrackMe challenge** by E-Shard
* **Range Village v1.0** by ASYNC Security Labs
* **Lanyard and electronic badge challenges** by our team (even the conference swag was hackable)

A huge number of students got to attend the conference for FREE due to the genrousity from [ISD (Internal Security Department)](https://www.isd.gov.sg/) and [INTfinity](https://intfinity.com.sg/) (Thanks to Delaney Ng and Benjamin Tan).

The best part? Some speakers told us they didn’t need travel reimbursements. We asked if we could donate those funds to charity instead - they said yes! We did dollar-to-dollar matching and sent everything to Singapore Children’s Cancer Foundation. We don’t usually talk about monetary donations, but the goodwill from our speakers deserved to be shared.

There are incredible and generous people and Govt agencies in this community.

## MSRC TOP 100[#](#msrc-top-100)

Two of our team members, Chen Le Qi and Cherie-Anne Lee managed to be in Microsoft’s MSRC Top 100.

## Conferences Talks[#](#conferences-talks)

We took our research around Asia this year:

**Code Blue Japan** - Presented TWO talks because one wasn’t enough. The jetlag was real but worth every minute.

## CTF CHAOS: BECAUSE WE LIVE FOR THIS[#](#ctf-chaos-because-we-live-for-this)

**Windows Exploitation Challenge** - Built a Windows Exploitation challenge where the prize was a free ticket to Off-By-One Conference. That’s right, Exploit your way into our event.

**Summer Pwnables** - Summer is for pwning! We gave out cash prizes and copies of Eugene “Spaceraccoon” Lim’s “From Day Zero to Zero Day” book. Winners collected their books directly from Eugene at the National Library book launch AND received a limited edition spaceraccoon plushie. Those plushies are legit collector’s items now.

**Women in Tech Singapore - Hex Advent** - The local Singapore women in tech community created 12 days of hacking challenges spread across the entire month of December with 0-days rest for the participants. 🎄 Each day brought a new challenge. No chocolate advent calendar here, just pure adrenaline cyberseucrity goodness.

## SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY[#](#supporting-the-community)

We sponsored NanoSec Asia and RE//verse because we believe in supporting the security community. Honestly wanted to sponsor more conferences but we can’t due to budget constraints. Hopefully we can do more in 2026.

## GIVING BACK (BECAUSE HACKERS HAVE HEARTS, NOT JUST BLACK HOODIES)[#](#giving-back-because-hackers-have-hearts-not-just-black-hoodies)

**November 2024: Operation Happy Meals Drop** - Rolled up to CPAS West School and gave EVERY single student and staff member a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Our first CSR mission and honestly? The smiles hit different. We found a vulnerability that day, turns out our hearts aren’t as hardened as our servers.

**Early 2025: Meals on Wheels Programme** - All the team members in Singapore office distributed meals to people who needed them. Because hackers care about people, not just systems.

**Our philosophy?** Exploit vulnerabilities in code, never in people.

## 💀 AND NOW, Our Epic Failures 💀[#](#-and-now-our-epic-failures-)

### THE DEVICE GRAVEYARD[#](#the-device-graveyard)

We bricked “Some” DEVICES along the way. An honestly embarrassing amount of hardware. Devices came in full of potential, left as expensive paperweights. IoT devices? More like IoT bricks or IoT Junkyard now...
