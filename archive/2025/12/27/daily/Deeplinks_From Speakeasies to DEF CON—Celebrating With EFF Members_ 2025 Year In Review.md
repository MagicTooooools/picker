It’s been a great year to be on EFF’s membership team. There's no better feeling than hanging out with your fellow digital freedom supporters and being able to say, “Oh yeah, and we’re suing the government!” [We’ve](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-demands-answers-about-ice-spotting-app-takedowns) [done that](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/lawsuit-challenges-san-joses-warrantless-alpr-mass-surveillance) [a lot](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/labor-unions-eff-sue-trump-administration-stop-surveillance-free-speech-online) [this year](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/privacy-victory-judge-grants-preliminary-injunction-opmdoge-lawsuit)—and that’s all thanks to people like you.

As a token of appreciation for supporting EFF’s mission to protect privacy and free expression online for all people, we put a lot of care into meeting the members who make our work possible. Whether it’s hosting meetups, traveling to conferences, or finding new and fun ways to explain what we’re fighting for, connecting with you is always a highlight of the job.

### EFF Speakeasy Meet Ups

One of my favorite perks we offer for EFF members is exclusive invites for Speakeasy meet ups. It’s a chance for us to meet the very passionate members who fuel our work!

This year, we hosted Speakeasies across the country while making the rounds at conferences. We met supporters in Mesa, AZ during CactusCon; Pasadena, CA during SCALE; Portland, OR during BSidesPDX; New York, NY during HOPE and BSidesNYC; and Seattle, WA during our panel at the University of Washington.

Of course...
