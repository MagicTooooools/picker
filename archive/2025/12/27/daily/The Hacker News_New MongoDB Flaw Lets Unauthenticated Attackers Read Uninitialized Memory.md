[![MongoDB Flaw](data:image/png;base64... "MongoDB Flaw")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyT_32t0dBjwnGTamsqSrB1jdPxZFMFb_GMzemmxXBm3HbtqrnJNx4VqVUF8tMKdHStEwTAU-PLcOHDKsbHvF9SSVig_OGEnWFKl81BORRb5h34UUFitJuYJOF-Trvrq-nFm5m-AzFe_dQRWYJgCOTJvzVnSzXCRgEAshv0EHR35OKUxGHr3qYg-M1vQHV/s790-rw-e365/mongodb.jpg)

A high-severity security flaw has been disclosed in MongoDB that could allow unauthenticated users to read uninitialized heap memory.

The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-14847** (CVSS score: 8.7), has been described as a case of [improper handling of length parameter inconsistency](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html), which arises when a program fails to appropriately tackle scenarios where a length field is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

"Mismatched length fields in Zlib compressed protocol headers may allow a read of uninitialized heap memory by an unauthenticated client," according to a [description](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-14847) of the flaw in CVE.org.

[![Cybersecurity](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/rat-d)

The flaw impacts the following versions of the database -

* MongoDB 8.2.0 through 8.2.3
* MongoDB 8.0.0 through 8.0.16
* MongoDB 7.0.0 through 7.0.26
* MongoDB 6.0.0 through 6.0.26
* MongoDB 5.0.0 through 5.0.31
* MongoDB 4.4.0 through 4.4.29
* All MongoDB Server v4.2 versions
* All MongoDB Server v4.0 versions
* All MongoDB Server v3.6 versions

The issue has been addressed in MongoDB versions 8.2.3, 8.0.17, 7.0.28, 6.0.27, 5.0.32, and 4.4.30.

"An client-side exploit of the Server's zlib implementation can return uninitialized heap memory without authenticating to the server," MongoDB [said](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-115508). "We strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version as soon as possible."

[![Cybersecurity](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/zscaler-ai-event-d)

If immediate update is not an option, it's recommended to [disable zlib compression](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/connect/connection-options/network-compression/) on the MongoDB Server by starting mongod or mongos with a [networkMessageCompressors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--networkMessageCompressors) or a [net.compression.compressors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-net.compression.compressors) option that explicitly omits zlib. The other compressor options supported by MongoDB are snappy and zstd.

"CVE-2025-14847 allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a condition in which the MongoDB server may return uninitialized memory from its heap," OP Innovate [said](https://op-c.net/blog/mongodb-zlib-protocol-vulnerability-cve-2025-14847/). "This could result in the disclosure of sensitive in-memory data, including internal state information, pointers, or other data that may assist an attacker in further exploitation."
