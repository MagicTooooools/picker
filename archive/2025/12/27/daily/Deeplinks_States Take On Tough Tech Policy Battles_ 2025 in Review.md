State legislatures—from [Olympia, WA](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/right-repair-law-washington-state), to [Honolulu, HI](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/hawaii-takes-stand-privacy-hcr-144hr-138-calls-investigation-crisis-pregnancy), to [Tallahassee, FL](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/floridas-anti-encryption-bill-wrecking-ball-privacy-theres-still-time-stop-it), and everywhere in between—kept EFF’s state legislative team busy throughout 2025.

We saw some great wins and steps forward this year. Washington became the [eighth state](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/right-repair-law-washington-state) to enshrine the right to repair. Several states [stepped up to protect the privacy of location data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/privacy-map-how-states-are-fighting-location-surveillance), with bills recognizing your location data isn't just a pin on a map—it's a powerful tool that reveals far more than most people realize. Other state legislators moved to [protect health privacy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/new-yorkers-deserve-stronger-health-data-protections-now-governor-hochul-can-make). And California passed a law making it easier for people to [exercise their privacy rights](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/tell-governor-newsom-make-it-easier-use-your-privacy-rights) under the state’s consumer data privacy law.

Several states also took up debates around how to legislate and regulate artificial intelligence and its many applications. We’ll continue to work with allies in states including [California](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/yes-californias-no-robo-bosses-act) and [Colorado](http://www.eff.or...
