# Drones to Diplomas: How Russia’s Largest Private University is Linked to a $25M Essay Mill

A sprawling academic cheating network turbocharged by Google Ads that has generated nearly $25 million in revenue has curious ties to a Kremlin-connected oligarch whose Russian university builds drones for Russia’s war against Ukraine.

The link between essay mills and Russian attack drones might seem improbable, but understanding it begins with a simple question: How does a human-intensive academic cheating service stay relevant in an era when students can simply ask AI to write their term papers? The answer – recasting the business as an AI company – is just the latest chapter in a story of many rebrands that link the operation to Russia’s largest private university.

Search in Google for any terms related to academic cheating services — e.g., “help with exam online” or “term paper online” — and you’re likely to encounter websites with the words “nerd” or “geek” in them, such as **thenerdify[.]com** and **geekly-hub[.]com**. With a simple request sent via text message, you can hire their tutors to help with any assignment.

These nerdy and geeky-branded websites frequently cite their “honor code,” which emphasizes they do not condone academic cheating, will not write your term papers for you, and will only offer support and advice for customers. But according to [This Isn’t Fine](https://thisisntfine.substack.com/), a Substack blog about contract cheating and essay mills, the Nerdify brand of websites will happily ignore that mantra.

“We tested the quick SMS for a price quote,” wrote This Isn’t Fine author **Joseph Thibault**. “The honor code references and platitudes apparently stop at the website. Within three minutes, we confirmed that a full three-page, plagiarism- and AI-free MLA formatted Argumentative essay could be ours for the low price of $141.”

Google prohibits ads that “enable dishonest behavior.” Yet, a sprawling global essay and homework cheating network run under the Nerdy brands has quietly bought its way to the top of Google searches – booking revenues of almost $25 million through a maze of companies in Cyprus, Malta and Hong Kong, while pitching “tutoring” that delivers finished work that students can turn in.

When one Nerdy-related Google Ads account got shut down, the group behind the company would form a new entity with a front-person (typically a young Ukrainian woman), start a new ads account along with a new website and domain name (usually with “nerdy” in the brand), and resume running Google ads for the same set of keywords.

UK companies belonging to the group that have been shut down by Google Ads since Jan 2025 include:

–**Proglobal Solutions LTD** (advertised nerdifyit[.]com);
–**AW Tech Limited** (advertised thenerdify[.]com);
–**Geekly Solutions Ltd** (advertised geekly-hub[.]com).

Currently active Google Ads accounts for the Nerdify brands include:

**-OK Marketing LTD** (advertising geekly-hub[.]net⁩), formed in the name of **Olha Karpenko**, a young Ukrainian woman;
–**Two Sigma Solutions LTD** (advertising litero[.]ai), formed in the name of **Olekszij Pokatilo**.

Mr. Pokatilo has been in the essay-writing business since at least 2009, operating a paper-mill enterprise called Livingston Research alongside **Alexander Korsukov**, who is listed as an owner. According to [a lengthy account from a former employee](https://essayscam.org/forum/wc/interview-former-freelancer-working-livingston-6444/), Livingston Research mainly farmed its writing tasks out to low-cost workers from Kenya, Philippines, Pakistan, Russia and Ukraine.

Pokatilo moved from Ukraine to the United Kingdom in Sept. 2015 and co-founded a company called **Awesome Technologies**, which pitched itself as a way for people to outsource tasks by sending a text message to the service’s assistants.

The other co-founder of Awesome Technologies is 36-year-old **Filip Perkon**, a Swedish man living in London who touts himself as a serial entrepreneur and investor. Years before starting Awesome together, Perkon and Pokatilo co-founded a student group called **Russian Business Week** while the two were classmates at the London School of Economics. According to the Bulgarian investigative journalist **Christo Grozev**, Perkon’s birth certificate was issued by the Soviet Embassy in Sweden.

Around the time Perkon and Pokatilo launched Awesome Technologies, Perkon was building a social media propaganda tool called the **Russian Diplomatic Online Club**, which Perkon said would “turbo-charge” Russian messaging online. The club’s newsletter urged subscribers [to install in their Twitter accounts a third-party app called Tweetsquad](https://web.archive.org/web/20191030165048/https%3A//www.vice.com/en_us/article/jpnvax/the-russian-embassy-is-asking-people-to-become-twitter-bots) that would retweet Kremlin messaging on the social media platform.

Perkon was praised by the Russian Embassy in London for his efforts: During the contentious Brexit vote that ultimately led to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Russian embassy in London used this spam tweeting tool [to auto-retweet the Russian ambassador’s posts from supporters’ accounts](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/15/intelligence-watchdog-urged-to-look-at-russian-influence-on-brexit-vote).

Neither Mr. Perkon nor Mr. Pokatilo replied to requests for comment.

A review of corporations tied to Mr. Perkon as indexed by the business research service **North Data** finds he holds or held director positions in several U.K. subsidiaries of **Synergy**, Russia’s largest private education provider. Synergy has more than 35,000 students, and sells T-shirts with patriotic slogans such as “Crimea is Ours,” and “The Russian Empire — Reloaded.”

The president of Synergy is **Vadim Lobov**, a Kremlin insider whose headquarters on the outskirts of Moscow reportedly features a wall-sized portrait of **Russian President Vladimir Putin** in the pop-art style of Andy Warhol. For a number of years, Lobov and Perkon co-produced a cross-cultural event in the U.K. called **Russian Film Week**.
