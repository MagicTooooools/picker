# SuperSonic

An enterprise AI+BI platform that unifies LLM-powered Chat BI and semantic-layer Headless BI to provide conversational data insights.

Author:
Tencent Music

Since:
2023-06-12

[GitHub](https://github.com/tencentmusic/supersonic)

## Detailed Introduction

SuperSonic is an enterprise AI+BI platform designed to unify Chat BI (LLM-powered conversational analytics) and Headless BI (semantic-layer-driven analytics) into a production-ready system. The platform uses large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language queries while leveraging a semantic data layer to deliver accurate, explainable business intelligence, enabling analysts and business users to obtain insights via conversational interfaces.

## Main Features

* Conversational analytics: supports natural-language Q&A and iterative data exploration.
* Semantic layer: standardizes metrics and data sources to ensure consistent queries.
* Pipeline automation: end-to-end data ingestion, modeling, and visualization pipelines.
* Enterprise readiness: multi-tenancy and access control for production deployments.

## Use Cases

* Self-service analytics platforms where non-technical users obtain business insights via natural language.
* Embedding LLM capabilities into dashboards for intelligent Q&A and automated reporting.
* Building reusable semantic layers to enforce consistent data definitions and governance across teams.

## Technical Features

* Implemented in Java with a service-oriented architecture, suitable for enterprise data platforms and containerized deployment.
* Combines LLM inference with semantic-layer querying and supports pluggable data sources and model backends.
* Open-source repository available (see frontmatter); community contributions for plugins and adapters are welcome.
