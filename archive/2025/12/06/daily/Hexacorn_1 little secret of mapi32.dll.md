# 1 little secret of mapi32.dll

Posted on [2025-12-06](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/12/06/1-little-secret-of-mapi32-dll/ "12:07 am")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

The mapi32.dll is a stub DLL that acts as a proxy for MAPI API calls. Pretty much all its exported functions start with a *GetProxyDllEx* routine that tries very hard to find a target email client library that will deliver the requested functionality offered by a standardized MAPI interface.

The *GetProxyDllEx* routine is pretty complicated as it attempts to handle many cases – many of which are catering for various architectural choices Microsoft made around MAPI over last 3 decades. Okay, I lied, it’s actually more boring than complicated, and since I am always triggerhappy when it comes to quick wins, I will just describe one below.

As a side note, from a forensic perspective, the following registry entry may be of interest:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\AlwaysUseLegacyMapiRegistration
```

It determines how the MAPI provider DLL is being searched for. If it doesn’t exist, or the value is not 1, the search will focus primarily on the modern RoGetActivationFactory function; otherwise, it will search the MAPI providers the old-fashioned way (via Registry enumeration of HKLM\Software\Clients\Mail key).

Anyway, back to the quick win…

If we put the file *mapisvc.inf* in a PATH location, and attempt to load any MAPI API via rundll32.exe f.ex.:

```
rundll32 mapi32.dll, LaunchWizard
```

the *mapi32.dll* will try to load:

```
C:\Windows\System32\mapi32x.dll
```

This DLL may or not may be present on the OS, depending on the OS version. So it’s a bit of a Schrödinger phantom DLL. If you are lucky, and it doesn’t exist, it can be used to host a payload…

Note: the *mapi32x.dll* file name is hard coded and used in situations when a better MAPI DLL file cannot be found. In many cases there may be Email clients present on the system that will configure email client entries that will take precedence over *mapi32x.dll*, so YMMV and you simply need to test it for your specific scenario. Remember it’s a quick win, and these are usually low quality 🙂
