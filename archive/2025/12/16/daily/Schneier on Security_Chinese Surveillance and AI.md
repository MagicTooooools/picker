## Chinese Surveillance and AI

New report: “[The Party’s AI: How China’s New AI Systems are Reshaping Human Rights](https://aspi.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27122307/The-partys-AI-How-Chinas-new-AI-systems-are-reshaping-human-rights.pdf).” From a [summary article](https://www.aspi.org.au/report/the-partys-ai-how-chinas-new-ai-systems-are-reshaping-human-rights/):

> China is already the world’s largest exporter of AI powered surveillance technology; new surveillance technologies and platforms developed in China are also not likely to simply stay there. By exposing the full scope of China’s AI driven control apparatus, this report presents clear, evidence based insights for policymakers, civil society, the media and technology companies seeking to counter the rise of AI enabled repression and human rights violations, and China’s growing efforts to project that repression beyond its borders.
>
> The report focuses on four areas where the CCP has expanded its use of advanced AI systems most rapidly between 2023 and 2025: multimodal censorship of politically sensitive images; AI’s integration into the criminal justice pipeline; the industrialisation of online information control; and the use of AI enabled platforms by Chinese companies operating abroad. Examined together, those cases show how new AI capabilities are being embedded across domains that strengthen the CCP’s ability to shape information, behaviour and economic outcomes at home and overseas.
>
> Because China’s AI ecosystem is evolving rapidly and unevenly across sectors, we have focused on domains where significant changes took place between 2023 and 2025, where new evidence became available, or where human rights risks accelerated. Those areas do not represent the full range of AI applications in China but are the most revealing of how the CCP is integrating AI technologies into its political control apparatus.

The demographic future is in the continent of Africa. Africa are currently receiving their Information and Computer Technology and Infrastructure largely from China.

Understandable as, regarding Africa, the US and Europe are mainly concerned with extractive commerce, bulk agricultural products, and raw materials.

Chinese repressive technology and AI will be rooted deeply in Africa for decades to come.

@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards the quote opener,

> *“China is already the world’s largest exporter of AI powered surveillance technology; new surveillance technologies and platforms developed in China are also not likely to simply stay there.”*

Technically this is not quite correct, but practically it does not make any difference apart from actually the US, UK and other Five-Eyes are “already the world’s largest” when it comes to “surveillance technology” and have been through out the Cold War and upto today.

Where China has scored big is “Fast Moving Consumer Electronics”(FMCE) that has Internet Connectivity.

So Consumer electronics like security and home control tech, likewise TV’s, IoT and more recently your fridge, cooker and other kitchen appliances. Oh and don’t forget anything that has an app on your mobile device (including toys in bedrooms etc).

They devices talk to Amazon or China, and the Five-Eyes get it all.

But the thing is they are the sensors not the AI, it’s a difference that is lost on most people, untill you talk about “Client Side Scanning” that “searches for specifics”.

But moving on,

> *“Examined together, those cases show how new AI capabilities are being embedded across domains that strengthen the CCP’s ability to shape information, behaviour and economic outcomes at home and overseas.”*

Take CCP out and insert US or EU in there and it would be just as true, but less talked about in the MSM.

In the UK and Australia and other Western Nations is the “think of the children” “PAPERS NOW” of Age Control systems.

The fact is I and others have been warning that Current AI LLM and ML systems are in effect “Surveillance 3.0” as part of Web3.0 etc.

You only have to look at the madness coming out of Palantir to see that we are being pushed down a slope into “Surveillance Hell” as fast as politicians can pass the legislation.

The fact too many people have “warm cuddly feelings” about Current AI actually scares me way more than just about anything else in society.

Unless we pull the plug on Current AI and the new systems arising and the get rich quick idiots behind it, we will have no Privacy, thus Society as we know it.

Clive, even though I’ve been reading some of your comments here for years, I’m still surprised that a tech professional like yourself would write those last two paragraphs. So,it’s not just an “old guy”(I’m 63) like me that is concerned.

It’s interesting how the **definition of ‘AI safety’** diverges between China and liberal democracies.

In China, ‘AI safety’ overwhelmingly serves the state rather than the individual. The largest segment of attended AI risk relates to violations of core socialist values, eg, criticism of the CCP, terrorism, etc.

Liberal democracies conceive of ‘AI safety’ as protecting people and institutions from harm, though often falling short. Harms can and do emerge as ‘unintended by-products of weak oversight, commercial incentives or policy inertia.’

As a topic covered in Chapter 1, the reader might find it interesting how LLMs from different ecosystems describe the same image differently. Check out four examples starting on page 71; you may observe omissions or careful reframings.

To me of most critical note are the **Policy Recommendations** on pages 63 to 66.

Some of these...
