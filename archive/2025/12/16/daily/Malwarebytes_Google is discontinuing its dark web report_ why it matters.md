# Google is discontinuing its dark web report: why it matters

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 16, 2025

![don't want to know what the dark web knows about me](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/cover_your_ears.png?w=1200)

Google has [announced](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/16767242?hl=en&ref_topic=7028834&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS) that early next year they are discontinuing the dark web report, which was meant to monitor breach data that’s circulating on the dark web.

The news [raised some eyebrows](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pn9o26/google_is_officially_discontinuing_dark_web/), but Google says it’s ending the feature because feedback showed the reports didn’t provide “helpful next steps.” New scans will stop on January 15, 2026, and on February 16, the entire tool will disappear along with all associated monitoring data. Early reactions are mixed: some users express disappointment and frustration, others seem largely indifferent because they already rely on alternatives, and a small group feels relieved that the worry‑inducing alerts will disappear.

All those sentiments are understandable. Knowing that someone found your information on the dark web does not automatically make you safer. You cannot simply log into a dark market forum and ask criminals to delete or return your data.

But there is value in knowing what’s out there, because it can help you respond to the situation before problems escalate. That’s where dark web and data exposure tools show their use: they turn vague fear (“Is my data out there?”) into specific risk (“This email and password are in a breach.”).

The [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/07/explained-dark-web) is often portrayed as a shady corner of the internet where stolen data circulates endlessly, and to some extent, that’s accurate. Password dumps, personal records, social security numbers (SSNs), and credit card details are traded for profit. Once combined into massive credential and identity databases accessible to cybercriminals, this information can be used for account takeovers, phishing, and identity fraud.

There are no tools to erase critical information that is circulating on dark web forums but that was never really the promise.

Google says it is shifting its focus towards “tools that give you more actionable steps,” like Password Manager, Security Checkup, and Results About You. Without doubt, those tools help, but they work better when users understand why they matter. Discontinuing dark web report removes a simple visibility feature, but it also reminds users that cybersecurity awareness means staying careful on the open web and understanding what attackers might use against them.

## How can Malwarebytes help?

The real value comes from three actions: being aware of the exposure, cutting off easy new data sources, and reacting quickly when something goes wrong.

This is where dedicated security tools can help you.

Malwarebytes [Personal Data Remover](https://www.malwarebytes.com/personal-data-remover) assists you in discovering and removing your data from [data broker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-brokers) sites (among others), shrinking the pool of information that can be aggregated, resold, or used to profile you.

Our [Digital Footprint scan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/digital-footprint) gives you a clearer picture of where your data has surfaced online, including exposures that could eventually feed into dark web dat...
