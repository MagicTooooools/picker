In episode 81 of The AI Fix, Graham discovers that deepfakes are already marking your kids’ homework, while Mark glimpses the future when he discovers AI agents that can communicate by reading each other’s minds.

Also in this episode, a Chinese robot called Miro U proves six arms are better than two; Mark discovers a well known prompting technique doesn’t work unless you want to make your AI dumber; Network Rail delays 32 trains because of an AI photo of a wonky bridge; and our hosts ponder the explosion of progress on the ARC-AGI-2 reasoning benchmark.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of “The AI Fix” podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
