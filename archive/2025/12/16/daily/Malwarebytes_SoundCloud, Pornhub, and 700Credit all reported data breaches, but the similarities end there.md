# SoundCloud, Pornhub, and 700Credit all reported data breaches, but the similarities end there

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 16, 2025

![comparing apples and oranges](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/three-data-breaches-1.jpg?w=1200)

Comparing data breaches is like comparing apples and oranges. They differ on many levels. To news media, the size of the brand, how many users were impacted, and how it was done often dominate the headlines. For victims, what really matters is the type of information stolen. And for the organizations involved, the focus is on how they will handle the incident. So, let’s have a look at the three that showed up in the news feeds today.

## 700Credit

700Credit is a US provider of credit reports, preliminary credit checks, identity verification, fraud detection, and compliance tools for automobile, recreational vehicle, powersports, and marine dealerships.

In a [notice on its website](https://www.700credit.com/notice/), 700Credit informed media, partners, and affected individuals that it suffered a third-party supply-chain attack in late October 2025. According to the notice, an attacker gained unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). The breach involves data collected between May and October, impacting roughly 5.6 million people.

The supply-chain attack demonstrates the importance of how you handle attacks. [Reportedly](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/massive-data-breach-sees-credit-card-details-of-over-5-6-million-victims-leaked-heres-what-we-know), 700Credit communicates with more than 200 integration partners through application programming interfaces (APIs). When one of the partners was compromised in July, they failed to notify 700Credit. As a result, unnamed cybercriminals broke into that third-party’s system and exploited an API used to pull consumer information.

700Credit shut down the exposed third-party API, notified the FBI and FTC, and is mailing letters to victims offering credit monitoring while coordinating with dealers and state regulators.

## SoundCloud

SoundCloud is a leading audio streaming platform where users can upload, promote, stream, and share music, podcasts, and other audio content.

SoundCloud posted a [notice on its website](https://soundcloud.com/playbook-articles/protecting-our-users-and-our-service) stating that it recently detected unauthorized activity in an ancillary service dashboard. Ancillary services refer to specialized functions that help maintain stability and reliability. When SoundCloud contained the attack, it experienced denial-of-service attacks, two of which were able to temporarily disable its platform’s availability on the web.

An investigation found that no sensitive data such as financial or password data was accessed. The exposed data consisted of email addresses and information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles. The company estimates the incident affected roughly 20% of its user base.

## Pornhub

Pornhub is one of the world’s most visited adult video-sharing websites, allowing users to view content anonymously or create accounts to upload and interact with videos.

[Reportedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/12/16/pornhub-confirms-breach-user-search-watch-and-download-activity-stolen/), Pornhub disclosed that on November 8, 2025, a security breach at third-party analytics provider Mixpanel exposed “a limited set of analytic...
