# Transparency, Openness, and Our 2023-2024 Financials

Every year, as required by U.S. federal law for 501(c)(3) nonprofits, the Tor Project completes a Form 990, and as required by contractual obligations and state regulations, an independent audit of our financial statements. After completing standard audits for 2023-2024,\* we added our [federal tax filings (Form 990)](https://www.torproject.org/static/findoc/2023-2024-TheTorProject-PublicDisclosureForm990.pdf?h=d509d409) and [audited financial statements](https://www.torproject.org/static/findoc/2023-2024-The_Tor_Project-AuditedFinancialStatements.pdf?h=701fdadb) to our website. We upload all of our tax documents and publish a blog post about these documents in order to be transparent.

(These documents have been available on our website for a while, but we are just now able to publish this blog post because of limited capacity. We hope you understand!)

Transparency for a privacy project is not a contradiction: privacy is about choice, and we choose to be transparent in order to build trust and a stronger community. In this post, we aim to be very clear about where the Tor Projectâs money comes from and what we do with it. This is how we operate in all aspects of our work: we show you all of our projects, in source code, and in periodic project and team [reports](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-project/), and in collaborations with [researchers](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-pets-and-privacy-research-community) who help assess and improve Tor. Transparency also means being clear about our values, promises, and priorities as laid out in our [social contract](https://community.torproject.org/policies/social_contract/).

We hope that by expanding each subsection of this post and adding more detail, you will have an even better understanding of the Tor Projectâs funding, and that you will be able to read the [audited financial statements and Form 990](https://torproject.org/about/reports) on your own should you have more questions.

\**Our fiscal years run from July through June instead of following the calendar year.*

## Fiscal Year 2023-2024 Summary

The audit and tax filing forms we discuss in this post cover July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. During this fiscal period, the Tor Project realized some of the benefits of the organizationâs investment in fundraising capacity with new staff, new policies and procedures, and a focus on diversifying the organizationâs funding sources.

**Weâre happy to continue to see the results of this strategy pay off, and we could not have done this without your support and belief in the Tor Projectâs vision.**

## Revenue & Support

The Tor Projectâs **Revenue and Support** in fiscal year 2023-2024, as listed in the **audited financial statement**, was **$8,005,661**.

![Image statement activities](/financials-blog-post-2023-2024/statement-activities.png)

In our Form 990, our **Revenue** is listed as $7,287,566.

![Image revenue 990](/financials-blog-post-2023-2024/revenue-990.png)

**The difference between revenue on the Form 990 and the audited financials is not a mistake**. The different revenue totals reflect differences in rules about how you must report tax revenue to the IRS and how you must report revenue in audited financial statements. The Tor Projectâs audited financial statements include in-kind contributions ($768,413) as a form of revenue, while the Form 990 includes the in-kind contributions as an expense.

[*In-kind contributions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifts_in_kind) is a term to describe non-monetary donations from the community. **In 2023-2024, the Tor community contributed $768,413 in donated services or goods**. That's an estimated 7,614 hours of software development, 1,894,720 words translated, cloud hosting services for 23 servers, and 26 certificates. Right now, this estimation does not include relay operator time and cost, but it should. We are working to better estimate both the hours of software development and how to represent the contributions made by relay operators. Stay tuned for the coming years! Clearly, Tor would not be possible without you. Thank you.

For the purposes of the following subsections of this blog post, **weâll be looking at the Revenue total following the 990**, and breaking this total into the following categories:

* U.S. Government (35.08% of total revenue) $2,556,472
* Corporations (21.59% of total revenue) $1,573,300
* Foundations (18.67% of total revenue) $1,395,494
* Individual Donations (15.61% of total revenue) $1,102,619
* Non-U.S. Governments (7.58% of total revenue) $552,387
* Other (1.47% of total revenue) $107,293

### U.S. Government

During this fiscal year, about 35.08% of our revenue came from U.S. government funds. For a comparison, in fiscal year 2021-2022, 53.5% of our revenue came from the U.S. government. You can see that our long-term mission to reduce our dependence on U.S. government funding has been coming to fruition. Of course thereâs still more work to be done, and your support helps Tor realize this goal.

We get a lot of questions (and see a lot of [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt)) about how the U.S. government funds the Tor Project, so we want to make this as clear as possible and show you where to find this information in the future in these publicly-available documents.

Let's talk specifically about which parts of the U.S. government have supported Tor, and what kind of projects they fund. Below, you can see a screenshot from the Tor Project's fiscal year 2023-2024 Form 990 on page 46 and 47, where we've listed all of our U.S. government funders. You will find text like this in all of our recent Form 990s:

Now, we'll break down which projects are funded by each entity and link you to places in [GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org) where we organize the work associated with this funding.
