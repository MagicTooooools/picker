# Android mobile adware surges in second half of 2025

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 16, 2025

*Android users spent 2025 walking a tighter rope than ever, with* *malware, data‑stealing apps, and SMS‑borne scams all climbing sharply while attackers refined their business models around mobile data and access.*

Looking back, we may view 2025 as the year when one-off scams were replaced on the score charts by coordinated, well-structured, attack frameworks.

Comparing two equal six‑month periods—December 2024 through May 2025 versus June through November 2025—our data shows Android adware detections nearly doubled (90% increase), while PUP detections increased by roughly two‑thirds and malware detections by about 20%.

The strong rise in SMS-based attacks we [flagged in June](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/android-threats-rise-sharply-with-mobile-malware-jumping-by-151-since-start-of-year) indicates that 2025 is the payoff year. The capabilities to steal one‑time passcodes are no longer experimental; they’re being rolled into campaigns at scale.

## The shift from nuisances to serious crime

Looking at 2024 as a whole, malware and PUPs together made up almost 90% of Android detections, with malware rising to about 43% of the total and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) to 45%, while adware slid to around 12%.

That mix tells an important story: Attackers are spending less effort on noisy annoyance apps and more on tools that can quietly harvest data, intercept messages, or open the door to full account takeover.

But that’s not because adware and PUP numbers went down.

Shahak Shalev, Head of AI and Scam Research at Malwarebytes pointed out:

> The holiday season may have just kicked off, but cybercriminals have been laying the groundwork for months for successful Android malware campaigns. In the second half of 2025, we observed a clear escalation in mobile threats. Adware volumes nearly doubled, driven by aggressive families like MobiDash, while PUP detections surged, suggesting attackers are experimenting with new delivery mechanisms. I urge everyone to stay vigilant over the holidays and not be tempted to click on sponsored ads, pop-ups or shop via social media. If an offer is too good to be true, it usually is.”

For years, [Android/Adware.MobiDash](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/android-adware-mobidash) has been one of the most common unwanted apps on Android. MobiDash comes as an adware software development kit (SDK) that developers (or repackagers) bolt onto regular apps to flood users with pop‑ups after a short delay. In 2025 it still shows up in our stats month after month, with thousands of detections under the MobiDash family alone.

So, threats like MobiDash are far from gone, but they increasingly become background noise against more serious threats that now stand out.

Over that same December–May versus June–November window, adware detections nearly doubled, PUP detections rose by about 75%, and malware detections grew by roughly 20%.

In the adware group, MobiDash alone grew its monthly detection volume by more than 100% between early and late 2025, even as adware as a whole remained a minority share of Android threats. In just the last three months we measured, MobiDash activity surged by about 77%, with detections climbing steadily from September through November.

## A more organized approach

Rather than relying on deliveri...
