The security vulnerability known as **[React2Shell](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/react2shell-exploitation-delivers.html)** is being exploited by threat actors to deliver malware families like KSwapDoor and ZnDoor, according to findings from Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 and NTT Security.

"KSwapDoor is a professionally engineered remote access tool designed with stealth in mind," Justin Moore, senior manager of threat intel research at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, said in a statement.

"It builds an internal mesh network, allowing compromised servers to talk to each other and evade security blocks. It uses military-grade encryption to hide its communications and, most alarmingly, features a 'sleeper' mode that lets attackers bypass firewalls by waking the malware up with a secret, invisible signal."

The cybersecurity company [noted](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2025-55182-react-and-cve-2025-66478-next/) that it was previously mistakenly classified as [BPFDoor](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/react2shell-exploitation-delivers.html#update), adding that the Linux backdoor offers interactive shell, command execution, file operations and lateral movement scanning capabilities. It also impersonates a legitimate Linux kernel swap daemon to evade detection.

In a related development, NTT Security [said](https://jp.security.ntt/insights_resources/tech_blog/react2shell_malware_zndoor/) organizations in Japan are being targeted by cyber attacks exploiting React2Shell to deploy ZnDoor, a malware that's been assessed to be detected in the wild since December 2023. The attack chains involve running a bash command to fetch the payload from a remote server (45.76.155[.]14) using wget and executing it.

A remote access trojan, it contacts the same threat actor-controlled infrastructure to receive commands and execute them on the host. Some of the supported commands are listed below -

* shell, to execute a command
* interactive\_shell, to launch an interactive shell
* explorer, to get a list of directories
* explorer\_cat, to read and display a file
* explorer\_delete, to delete a file
* explorer\_upload, to download a file from the server
* explorer\_download, to send files to the server
* system, to gather system information
* change\_timefile, to change the timestamp of a file
* socket\_quick\_startstreams, to start a SOCKS5 proxy
* start\_in\_port\_forward, to start port forwarding
* stop\_in\_port, to stop port forwarding

The disclosure comes as the vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-55182](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/critical-advisory-remote-code-execution-in-next-js-cve-2025-66478-with-working-exploit/) (CVSS score: 10.0), has been [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/react2shell-exploitation-escalates-into.html) by multiple threat actors, Google [identifying](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/weekly-recap-apple-0-days-winrar.html) at least five China-nexus groups that have weaponized it to distribute an array of payloads -

* UNC6600, to deliver a tunneling utility named MINOCAT
* UNC6586, to deliver a downloader named SNOWLIGHT
* UNC6588, to deliver a backdoor named COMPOOD
* UNC6603, to deliver an updated version of a Go backdoor named HISONIC that uses Cloudflare Pages and GitLab to retrieve encrypted configuration and blend in with legitimate network activity
* UNC6595, to deliver a Linux version of ANGRYREBEL (aka Noodle RAT)

Microsoft, in its own advisory for CVE-2025-55182, said threat actors have taken advantage of the flaw to run arbitrary commands for post-exploitation, including setting up reverse shells to known Cobalt Strike servers, and then dropping remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as MeshAgent, modifying the authorized\_keys file, and enabling root login.

Some of the payloads delivered in these attacks include VShell, EtherRAT, SNOWLIGHT, ShadowPad, and XMRig. The attacks are also characterized by the use of Cloudflare Tunnel endpoints ("\*.trycloudflare.com") to evade security defenses, as well as conducting reconnaissance of the compromised environments to facilitate lateral movement and credential theft.

The credential harvesting activity, the Windows maker said, targeted Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoints for Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Tencent Cloud with the end goal of acquiring identity tokens to burrow deeper into cloud infrastructures.

"Attackers also deployed secret discovery tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks, along with custom scripts to extract several different secrets," the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team [said](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/12/15/defending-against-the-cve-2025-55182-react2shell-vulnerability-in-react-server-components/). "Attempts to harvest AI and cloud-native credentials, such as OpenAI API keys, Databricks tokens, and Kubernetes service‑account credentials, were also observed. Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (az) and Azure Developer CLI (azd) were also used to obtain tokens."
