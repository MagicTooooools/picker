## Introduction

In many penetration testing assessments, it is common to encounter applications that support multiple user roles, such as admin, normal user, approver, and others.

Consequently, testers are often provided with accounts and credentials for various roles during a grey-box assessment.

During a penetration test, the focus is often on identifying technical vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injections, and other issues by adhering to testing methodologies or security standards like the OWASP ASVS [[1]](#[1]). However, vulnerabilities such as Broken Access Control, IDORs (Insecure Direct Object Reference), and Business Logic Flaws tend to be overlooked due to their complexity, which requires manual effort and a thorough understanding of the application’s purpose and design.

This article aims to enhance your understanding and testing of these overlooked vulnerabilities. We will define these vulnerabilities and provide insights into distinguishing and assessing them more effectively.

Furthermore, the article will explore the significance and methodology of “Abuse Case Scenarios”, a strategic approach used to identify and validate vulnerabilities through scenarios that are custom-made and specific to each application.

A real-world example related to an IDOR flaw will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, along with practical approaches and tips.

Finally, we will highlight recommendations and remediation strategies for these vulnerabilities, offering guidance on strengthening the security posture of applications.

### Identifying an Application’s Flow and Purpose

Prior to defining and testing Abuse Case Scenarios, the first and most important step is to get a good idea of the purpose of the application. This could contain the following actions:

* Identifying the different user roles within the application

In an application that manages employee leave requests, an employee should be able to submit leave requests. Additionally, appropriate roles such as a manager should have the authority to approve these requests.

* Understanding the permissions and access levels assigned to each role

 Should an employee be able to approve their own leave? Is there a specific procedure that is taking place?

* Observing the functionalities and data accessible to each role

Should an employee be able to view or modify their own or other users’ leave?

### Understanding the Authorization Mechanism in Place

After starting to get a good idea of the users’ roles and the application’s purpose, the next step is to determine how users and their actions are distinguished. Some examples could be:

* Session Cookies
* JWT Tokens
* API Keys
* OAuth Tokens
* CSRF Tokens
* Identifiers

## Creating Abuse Cases Scenarios

After establishing a solid understanding of the application’s purpose, flows, and authorization mechanisms, it is the ideal time to begin defining Abuse Case Scenarios.
Abuse Cases are a list of scenarios that outline actions a user or user role should not be able to perform, given their rights within the application.
These scenarios help outline the structure of the application, such as the flow behind the completion of an action, the differences between user roles, and important functionalities that may be uncovered.

The following is a list of vulnerabilities that these scenarios can discover:

* Incorrect user behavior flow implementation
* Lack of server-side controls
* Authorization issues
* IDORs
* Broken Access Control
* Business Logic Flaws

Due to the uniqueness of user roles and other related features of each application, it is important to note that Abuse Cases differ from application to application, as they are closely related to the application’s functionalities and purpose.

Some examples of Abuse Cases Scenarios are the following:

* As an authenticated user, I should not be able to modify another user’s bank account information
* As an authenticated employee, I should not be able to approve a requested leave
* As an authenticated customer, I should not be able to complete a transaction without making a payment
* As an authenticated customer, I should not be able to alter the price of an item during the purchase process

### Invalid Abuse Cases

It is worth to note that technical controls are not Abuse Cases. The following are some examples of invalid Abuse Cases:

* As an authenticated user, I should not be able to perform an SSRF attack via the PDF generation feature
* As an authenticated user, I should not be able to perform a stored XSS attack via the comments section

Additionally, each scenario should be specific and tied to a particular action or feature. For instance the following are some poor examples:

* As an authenticated employee, I should not be able to perform an administrative action
* As a authenticated approver, I should not be able to perform any actions that are restricted for my role

Instead, a better way would be to list each administrative or restricted action. Some examples would be:

* As an authenticated employee, I should not be able to delete a user account
* As an authenticated approver, I should not be able to assign the “manager” role to a user

### Finalization and Sharing with the Client

At NVISO, our priority is to provide the highest quality of work while staying closely aligned with the client’s needs. Therefore, once a comprehensive list of Abuse Cases covering the most important and critical functionalities of the application has been created and validated, it is essential to share this with the client. This will allow the client to make any modifications, comments, or add new scenarios if needed.

Note: It is possible that some scenarios may have been overlooked. This is common, as certain testing scenarios require a deeper understanding of user roles or specific functionalities that may not have been initially apparent.

During the testing of Abuse Cases, it is an excellent opportunity to identify additional exploitation scenarios. This iterative process allo...
