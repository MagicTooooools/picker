***Disclaimer:*** *On December 5, 2025, LockBit resurfaced with a newly branded Data Leak Site named after the latest version of its encryption tool. Although this report relies on data collected between January 1 and November 30, 2025, the CTI Team reviewed all posts published on the new LockBit DLS up to December 11, 2025.*

*Findings indicate that approximately 55% of the victims listed after the relaunch were previously disclosed on older LockBit DLS versions, suggesting that, at this stage, the group’s return does not materially affect the trends, assessments, or conclusions presented in this analysis.*

**Key Takeaways**

Based on the data analyzed in this report, the following observations are drawn in relation to the alliance announcement published on September 15, 2025:

* Ransomware claim distribution observed after the alliance post indicates a continued fragmentation of the ransomware ecosystem, with activity spread across a growing number of groups rather than consolidation around a single dominant actor.
* The increase in Qilin’s activity recorded in the weeks following the alliance announcement aligns temporally with increased underground visibility generated by the post.
* In the broader context highlighted by the alliance post, sustained pressure on traditional Ransomware as a Service groups and declining ransom payments might favor data only extortion models as a lower risk and more resilient approach.
* Time based analysis of Data Leak Site activity does not show evidence of an operational recovery for LockBit following the alliance announcement, despite renewed branding efforts and the public release of a new malware version.

# Introduction

On the occasion of the announcement made by the ransomware group DragonForce regarding the creation of an alliance between DragonForce, Qilin, and LockBit, identified on September 15, 2025, the Cyber Intelligence Team conducted an analysis based on internally collected data to assess the potential risk and the credibility of the claim. This activity was carried out as part of ongoing ransomware claims monitoring operations aimed at identifying emerging risks and issuing customer alerts.

The analysis leveraged ransomware claim data attributed to criminal gangs observed throughout 2025, with the objective of identifying trends that could indicate a potential shift in strategy among the groups involved in the alleged alliance, also considering the broader context of heightened pressure and possible fragmentation of the ransomware landscape during 2025.

Subsequently, a possible interpretative framework is provided, examining the situation preceding the publication of the thread and building upon previous analyses conducted on the LockBit collective, particularly in relation to the incident involving the dump of its management panel.

# Better Together

The post published on September 15, identified on a Russian underground forum and posted by the user “dragonforce”, announced the creation of the Qilin/LockBit/DragonForce ransomware cartel.

**Figure 1.** Post identified within a Russian underground forum

As stated in the message, the coalition is presented as necessary to face a “challenging” future (referred to as “challenge” in the original post) within the ransomware criminal ecosystem. The post presumably refers to multiple law enforcement actions carried out by international authorities, which have already led to the disruption of well-known ransomware groups such as HIVE (January 2023),[[1]](#fn1) AlphV/BlackCat (December 2023),[[2]](#fn2) and LockBit (February 2024),[[3]](#fn3),[[4]](#fn4) the latter being considered one of the most prolific ransomware collectives of all time.

In this context, the ransomware landscape has become a high-risk environment, as national and international law enforcement operations have not been limited to dismantling group infrastructures, but have also identified collective administrators and the identities of several Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operators, resulting in the issuance of international arrest warrants and the arrest of key members.[[5]](#fn5)

This situation has contributed to a more fragmented and less cohesive ransomware ecosystem, increasing the perceived risk for individuals seeking to engage in such criminal activities. This effect is particularly evident given that takedown operations have led to the dismantling of prominent groups of presumed or confirmed Russian origin, such as HIVE, AlphV/BlackCat, and LockBit, ultimately reducing the attractiveness of ransomware gangs from a recruitment perspective.

# It’s a hard way to the top if you wanna run ransomware

In support of this trend, an analysis conducted in May 2025 by the Yarix Intelligence Team on leaked data from the LockBit group[[6]](#fn6) revealed that the majority of affiliated operators were likely inexperienced, while only a small subset of skilled operators accounted for most of the attacks. The fact that most affiliates were “newbies” and that only a few meaningfully contributed to operations consequently reduced the group’s ability to attract new members. This applies not only to inexperienced affiliates, but also to seasoned operators, who increasingly perceive LockBit as a “dead man walking” a weakened organization trapped in the past and, above all, compromised by the impact of Operation Cronos.[[7]](#fn7)

## Fragmentation rather than recovery

Although overall figures suggest an increase in ransomware claims compared to 2024 with claims up approximately 61% year over year when comparing the January-November 2025 period to the same timeframe in 2024, analysts have observed a structural crisis within the ransomware ecosystem. As previously discussed, this crisis does not primarily concern the volume of operations, but rather the perception of a loss of “central” power following the dismantling of historically dominant groups such as HIVE, AlphV/BlackCat, and LockBit.

A further element supporting the fragmentation of the ransomware landscape emerges from the analysis of the percentage distribution of claims among the leading groups. In the January–November 2024 period, despite a lower overall number of claims (4,170), the top 10 ransomware groups accounted for approximately 54.8% of total claims, with a strong concentration around LockBit (10.36%) and RansomHub (9.66%). In the January–November 2025 period, despite an increase in total claims (5,998), the share attributed to the top 10 groups declines to approximately 53.1%, indicating a more even distribution of activity and the absence of a dominant actor, consistent with a more fragmented landscape.

This has led to the identification of several structural phenomena, including:

* **Fragmentation:** the fragmentation of ransomware groups, evidenced by the growth in the number of active groups and by the alliance discussed in this r...
