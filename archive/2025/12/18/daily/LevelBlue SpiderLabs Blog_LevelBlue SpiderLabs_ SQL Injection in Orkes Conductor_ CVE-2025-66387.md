# LevelBlue SpiderLabs: SQL Injection in Orkes Conductor: CVE-2025-66387

Change theme to light

December 18, 2025
1 Minute Read
by Tim Stamopoulos

[LevelBlue SpiderLabs](/spiderlabs/) has discovered a vulnerability in the Orkes Conductor platform (version 5.2.4 | v1.19.12) that allows authenticated attackers to perform time-based blind SQL injection attacks against the backend PostgreSQL database.

Orkes Conductor is a managed workflow orchestration platform used to model complex, distributed microservice and human workflows. The vulnerability arises from improper input validation on the “sort” parameter in the /api/workflow/search endpoint, enabling the injection of crafted SQL expressions directly into backend queries.

### Affected Product

* Product: Orkes Conductor
* Version: 5.2.4 (Platform v1.19.12)
* Component: /api/workflow/search
* Database: PostgreSQL
* CVE ID: CVE-2025-66387

#### Dedicated to hunting and eradicating the world’s most challenging threats.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerable endpoint accepts user-controlled input in the “sort” query parameter, which is directly embedded in SQL statements executed on the backend without proper sanitization. While basic filtering is in place to prevent common payloads, LevelBlue researchers successfully bypassed these checks using time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

The following proof-of-concept payload resulted in a deliberate five-second delay in the server’s response, confirming the presence of a time-based SQL injection vulnerability:

`?sort=(SELECT 1371 FROM PG_SLEEP(5))`
