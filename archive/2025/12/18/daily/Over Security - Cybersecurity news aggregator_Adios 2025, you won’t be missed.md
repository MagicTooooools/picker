[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

For us in America, we’re in the holiday doldrums and things slow and/or shut down until the new year. At Cisco, we shut down the last week of the year to reset and recharge, and I’ve grown to be quite fond of it. I’ve worked plenty of gigs where there were no holiday breaks, and now that I’m living that dream, I gotta tell ya, it’s a damn civilized way to live if you can get it.

It’s only natural for us to think on 2025 — what happened to us, what made the news, and with some trepidation (and maybe some hope) what lies in store for 2026.

I thought I’d summarize the notable things that come to mind for me:

1. [Uncovering Qilin attack methods exposed through multiple cases](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uncovering-qilin-attack-methods-exposed-through-multiple-cases/)
   Why this one? Quilin is one of the more aggressive cartels that I see in the ransomware space in 2025. On their dark web site, you can see a very active presence. When Talos crunches the numbers for the 2025 Year in Review, don’t be surprised if you see them at the top of the list as one of the more lucrative criminal cartels. Our blog post on this was outstanding — give it a read! (Also, our banner art is just great, if I do say so myself. Our design team is the best.) I think 2026 will see a heavy ransomware tempo. It is simply just too lucrative for the bad guys. Compounding this is the macro/micro world economy and good old fashioned geopolitical tensions. Everyone hold on tight.
2. [Jaguar Land Rover posts heavy loss after cyber attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1w255gy1o)
   As someone who focuses on industrial control security, seeing a manufacturer getting hit so hard resonates with me. It proves the fragility that we see in this space, where operational and information technology mix to fulfill business imperatives, but at a real financial risk.  This will be a case study of financial impacts cyber attacks can have on manufacturing with a heavily targeted vertical because the disruptions are costly and lucrative to ransomware actors. My bet is 2026 will see much more of this. *No one* wants to be the next Land Rover Jaguar. The bad guys know this, and there’s certainly blood in the water and the sharks have noticed.
3. [Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign](https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage)
   Anthropic released a first of its kind report on a state-sponsored adversary using Claude to launch a full kill chain campaign against victims. I had a hard time with this report. It felt (and still feels) hyped to a degree. It’s an entirely plausible scenario, and I don’t want to imply it’s misleading! But the report doesn’t show its work. You can certainly see this being real, but it just misses the test for actual substantive intel. Still, it surely does make one wonder how much better AI attacks will get. The space is moving at blazing speed. Who’s to say what 2026 will show us for attacks and defense!

If you celebrate, enjoy the holidays. At the same time, I know this season can feel especially lonely for those of us who are missing loved ones. This year I lost my grandmother, and I am still processing the tremendous grief and loss for someone who helped raise me to be the man I am today. Find the time to spend with others and be kind to yourself. Resist the urge to isolate yourself. Use the holidays to invest in yourself and your health. I believe in you. I’ll see you all in 2026.

## The one big thing

For this [end-of-year Talos Takes episode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2018149/episodes/18364906) — and Hazel’s last as host — we took a time machine back to 2015 to ask, “What would a defender from back then think of the madness we deal with in 2025?” Alongside Pierre, Alex, and yours truly, we reminisced about our own journeys, then got into the real meat: just how much ransomware has exploded (thanks, “as-a-service” model), why identity is now the main battleground, and how the lines between state-sponsored actors and APTs have blurred to the point of being almost meaningless.

### Why do I care?

You don’t need me to tell you it’s a different world than it was ten years ago. The ransomware industry is bigger and nastier than ever, and attackers are more organized, more efficient, and more professionalized. The tools (and the stakes) keep changing, but burnout and complexity are constants. If you’re not keeping pace, you’re falling behind, and the attackers aren’t waiting up.

### So now what?

Don’t panic, and don’t try to win it all alone. Double down on the basics, like identity and access management and keeping tabs on those “service accounts” that keep multiplying. Make sure your team is trained, supported, and has permission to step away from the keyboard once in a while. Don’t get distracted by AI; it *is* powerful, but it’s not a magic bullet. And maybe most important of all: Take care of yourself and your people. 2026 is going to bring more of the same (and some surprises), but if you stay grounded, curious, and human, you’ll be ready for whatever’s next.
