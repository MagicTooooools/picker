# Chrome extension slurps up AI chats after users installed it for privacy

*This case highlights a growing grey area in consumer privacy: data collection that is technically disclosed, but so far outside user expectations that most people would never knowingly agree to it.*

The next time you tell an AI chat assistant your deepest secrets, think twice; you never know who (or what) might be listening. More than seven million users of a VPN extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge found that out the hard way this week after researchers at Koi Security revealed the browser extension had been logging users’ AI chats and sending them to a data broker.

Urban VPN Proxy looked like a reputable program. It sat in the Chrome Web Store with a 4.7-star rating and Google’s “Featured” badge, which is meant to indicate that an extension meets higher standards for user experience and design. More than six million people downloaded the Chrome version of the tool, which ironically claims to protect users’ online privacy. Another 1.3 million installed it on Microsoft Edge.

The extension was originally benign, but then on July 9, 2025 its publisher, Urban Cybersecurity, shipped version 5.5.0. According to Koi Security, that update introduced code that intercepted every conversation users had with eight AI assistant platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), and Meta AI.

The extension intercepted chat prompts from the user’s browser, along with responses from the AI. It then reportedly packaged them up and sent them to Urban Cybersecurity’s parent company, BiScience (B.I Science (2009) Ltd). That is a data broker company, which collects browsing history and device IDs from millions of users.

As Koi Security points out in its report, Urban Cybersecurity *does* mention AI data collection in the consent screen that it shows during product setup. It says:

> “…we process certain browsing data such as pages you visit, your network connection, ChatAI communication, and security signals, as outlined in our Privacy Policy.”

The privacy policy further explains what data it collects and says that it discloses the data for marketing analytics purposes.

There are two problems with that.

First, the extension silently auto-updates on Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers, as Koi Security points out. That means users who installed an earlier, non-harvesting version installed would have been automatically upgraded to the chat-slurping version in July and been none the wiser—unless they happened to read updated privacy policies for fun.

fromSecond, the Chrome Web Store listing reportedly described the product as protecting people from entering personal information into AI chatbots. That claim is hard to square with the fact that the extension captures and exfiltrates AI chats regardless of whether its protection features are turned on, according to Koi.

The researchers also found that seven other extensions from the same publisher contained identical harvesting code, bringing the total number of affected users to more than eight million. Koi Security published a list of those extensions in its [report](https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection).

With people inclined to tell AI sessions increasingly personal things, this secretive harvesting should worry ...
