Within the past year, artificial intelligence copilots and agents have quietly permeated the SaaS applications businesses use every day. Tools like Zoom, Slack, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and ServiceNow now come with built-in AI assistants or agent-like features. Virtually every major SaaS vendor has rushed to embed AI into their offerings.

The result is an explosion of AI capabilities across the SaaS stack, a phenomenon of [AI sprawl](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/naksec_slack-googledrive-salesforce-activity-7391469900281606144-AEr6/) where AI tools proliferate without centralized oversight. For security teams, this represents a shift. As these AI copilots scale up in use, they are changing how data moves through SaaS. An AI agent can connect multiple apps and automate tasks across them, effectively creating new integration pathways on the fly.

An AI meeting assistant might automatically pull in documents from SharePoint to summarize in an email, or a sales AI might cross-reference CRM data with financial records in real time. These AI data connections form complex, dynamic pathways that traditional static app models never had.

## **When AI Blends In - Why Traditional Governance Breaks**

This shift has exposed a fundamental weakness in legacy SaaS security and governance. Traditional controls assumed stable user roles, fixed app interfaces, and human-paced changes. However, AI agents break those assumptions. They operate at machine speed, traverse multiple systems, and often wield higher-than-usual privileges to perform their job. Their activity tends to blend into normal user logs and generic API traffic, making it hard to distinguish an AI's actions from a person's.

Consider Microsoft 365 Copilot: when this AI fetches documents that a given user wouldn't normally see, it leaves little to no trace in standard audit logs. A security admin might see an approved service account accessing files, and not realize it was Copilot pulling confidential data on someone's behalf. Similarly, if an attacker hijacks an AI agent's token or account, they can quietly misuse it.

Moreover, AI identities don't behave like human users at all. They don't fit neatly into existing IAM roles, and they often require very broad data access to function (far more than a single user would need). Traditional data loss prevention tools struggle because once an AI has wide read access, it can potentially aggregate and expose data in ways no simple rule would catch.

Permission drift is another challenge. In a static world, you might review integration access once a quarter. But AI integrations can change capabilities or accumulate access quickly, outpacing periodic reviews. Access often drifts silently when roles change or new features turn on. A scope that seemed safe last week might quietly expand (e.g., an AI plugin gaining new permissions after an update) without anyone realizing.

All these factors mean static SaaS security and governance tools are falling behind. If you're only looking at static app configurations, predefined roles, and after-the-fact logs, you can't reliably tell what an AI agent actually did, what data it accessed, which records it changed, or whether its permissions have outgrown policy in the interim.

## **A Checklist for Securing AI Copilots and Agents**

Before introducing new tools or frameworks, security teams should pressure-test their current posture.

| Question | ✓ |
| --- | --- |
| Do we know every copilot, agent, and integration running in our SaaS environment? | [ ] |
| Do we know what each one can access right now? | [ ] |
| Can we see what each one actually did across apps? | [ ] |
| Can we spot access drift as it happens? | [ ] |
| If something goes wrong, can we reconstruct what happened end to end? | [ ] |
| Can we block risky actions in real time, not just alert after? | [ ] |
| Do we know which OAuth tokens exist and what scopes they grant? | [ ] |
| Can we tell human activity from agent activity in logs? | [ ] |

If several of these questions are difficult for you to answer, it's a signal that static SaaS security models are no longer sufficient for AI tools.

## **Dynamic AI-SaaS Security - Guardrails for AI Apps**

To address these gaps, security teams are beginning to adopt what can be described as dynamic AI-SaaS security.

In contrast to static security (which treats apps as siloed and unchanging), dynamic AI-SaaS security is a policy driven, adaptive guardrail layer that operates in real-time on top of your SaaS integrations and OAuth grants. Think of it as a living security layer that understands what your copilots and agents are doing moment-to-moment, and adjusts or intervenes according to policy.

Dynamic AI-SaaS security monitors AI agent activity across all your SaaS apps, watching for policy violations, abnormal behavior, or signs of trouble. Rather than relying on yesterday's checklist of permissions, it learns and adapts to how an agent is actually being used.

A dynamic security platform will track an AI agent's effective access. If the agent suddenly touches a system or dataset outside its usual scope, it can flag or block that in real-time. It can also detect configuration drift or privilege creep instantly and alert teams before an incident occurs.

Another hallmark of dynamic AI-SaaS security is visibility and auditability. Because the security layer mediates the AI's actions, it keeps a detailed record of what the AI is doing across systems.
