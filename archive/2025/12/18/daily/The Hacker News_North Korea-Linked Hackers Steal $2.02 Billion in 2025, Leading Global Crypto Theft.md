[![North Korea-Linked Hackers](data:image/png;base64... "North Korea-Linked Hackers")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMHTdmzsADACELwHA_CbIZVsam4MNGitGEgbHD2jOysPFLnZerWmRSZtTJzSkOJagPS8pmFni0SE8Jp63CEMJFDTjnNx51ND6Px3RCC5W37i61m_PrgB7T5KoghRqtVCvy6A0Bx4LVnZFEm8CijNS2RxOlxeC_3roMiJRqe9bWn2N92dj77mjYsGptVWUS/s790-rw-e365/north-korean-hackers.jpg)

Threat actors with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) have been instrumental in driving a surge in global cryptocurrency theft in 2025, accounting for at least $2.02 billion out of more than $3.4 billion stolen from January through early December.

The figure represents a 51% increase year-over-year and $681 million more than 2024, when the threat actors stole $1.3 billion, according to Chainalysis' Crypto Crime Report shared with The Hacker News.

"This marks the most severe year on record for DPRK crypto theft in terms of value stolen, with DPRK attacks also accounting for a record 76% of all service compromises," the blockchain intelligence company [said](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2026/). "Overall, 2025's numbers bring the lower-bound cumulative estimate for cryptocurrency funds stolen by the DPRK to $6.75 billion."

The [February compromise](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/bybit-confirms-record-breaking-146.html) of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit alone is responsible for $1.5 billion of the $2.02 billion plundered by North Korea. The attack was [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/safewallet-confirms-north-korean.html) to a threat cluster known as [TraderTraitor](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/bluenoroff-deepfake-zoom-scam-hits.html) (aka Jade Sleet and Slow Pisces). An analysis [published](https://www.infostealers.com/article/exclusive-look-inside-a-compromised-north-korean-apt-machine-linked-to-the-biggest-heist-in-history/) by Hudson Rock earlier this month linked a machine infected with Lumma Stealer to infrastructure associated with the Bybit hack based on the presence of the email address "[trevorgreer9312@gmail[.]com](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/bybit-hack-traced-to-safewallet-supply.html)."

The cryptocurrency thefts are part of a broader series of attacks conducted by the North Korea-backed hacking group called Lazarus Group over the past decade. The adversary is also [believed](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251128003952320) to be involved in the theft of $36 million worth of cryptocurrency from South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, [Upbit](https://upbit.com/service_center/notice?id=5800&view=share), last month.

Lazarus Group is affiliated with Pyongyang's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). It's [estimated](https://paragraph.com/%40investigations/how-lazarus-group-laundered-200m-from-25-crypto-hacks-to-fiat-from-2020-2023) to have siphoned no less than $200 million from over 25 cryptocurrency heists between 2020 and 2023.

The nation-state adversary is one of the most prolific hacking groups that also has a track record of [orchestrating](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/blog/cert-news/a-pain-in-the-mist-navigating-operation-dreamjobs-arsenal) a long-running campaign referred to as [Operation Dream Job](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/north-korean-hackers-lure-defense.html), in which [prospective employees](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0022/) working in defense, manufacturing, chemical, aerospace, and technology sectors are approached via LinkedIn or WhatsApp with lucrative job opportunities to trick them into downloading and running malware such as [BURNBOOK, MISTPEN](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/north-korean-hackers-target-energy-and.html), and [BADCALL](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-group-adds-linux-malware-to.html), the last of which also comes in a [Linux version](https://hunt.io/blog/dprk-lazarus-kimsuky-infrastructure-uncovered).

The end goal of these efforts is two-pronged: to collect sensitive data and generate illicit revenue for the regime in violation of international sanctions imposed on the country.

A second approach adopted by North Korean threat actors is to [embed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/five-us-citizens-plead-guilty-to.html) information technology (IT) workers inside companies across the world [under false pretenses](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/lazarus-group-it-workers-investigation/), either in an individual capacity or through [front companies](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-front-companies.html) like [DredSoftLabs](https://medium.com/%40meeswicky1100/unmasking-a-new-dprk-front-company-dredsoftlabs-bf9ed544d690) and [Metamint Studio](https://medium.com/%40meeswicky1100/follow-up-blog-on-fake-dprk-dredsoftlabs-company-1f7721214acf) that are set up for this purpose. This also includes gaining privileged access to crypto services and enabling high‑impact compromises. The fraudulent operation has been nicknamed Wagemole.

"Part of this record year likely reflects an expanded reliance on IT worker infiltration at exchanges, custodians, and Web3 firms, which can accelerate initial access...
