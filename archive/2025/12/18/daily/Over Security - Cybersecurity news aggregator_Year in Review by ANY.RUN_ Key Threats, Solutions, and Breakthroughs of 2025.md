Year in Review by ANY.RUN: Key Threats, Solutions, and Breakthroughs of 2025

It’s December — that time of year when we take a pause and look back at how much we’ve achieved.

If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve shared these wins with us. Maybe you’ve launched one analysis, maybe thousands. Maybe you’ve browsed our [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=annual-report-2025&utm_term=181225&utm_content=linktotilookuplanding) daily or just joined us. Anyhow, thanks for being here!

2025 kept all of us busy for sure. But it also brought a ton of breakthrough studies, insights, and improvements. Let’s glance back at the year and see what we accomplished together — through numbers, stories, and proud moments.

## Milestones We Achieved Together in 2025

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/info-of-the-year-1024x894.png)

We bet it’s safe to say that no analyst was idle this year, and the numbers support this statement: the total number of analyses launched in [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=annual-report-2025&utm_term=181225&utm_content=linksandboxlanding) across 195(!) countries exceeded 5.7 millions, with 1.1 million threats uncovered in the process.

Our most active users this year were based in the US, Germany, UK, and India. Many of them represent big enterprises. In fact, 74 of Fortune 100 companies used our sandbox this year.

The community overall kept growing: out of 500,000+ users, 81k joined us this year, bringing new insights with them.

Altogether, ANY.RUN’s users have spent 400,000+ hours in our sandbox — that’s more than 45 years of research! Just imagine how much longer it would take without a solution built for fast and efficient analysis. 😎

When it comes to what exactly our community analyzed most, there are no surprises: in 2025, phishing continued to reign over the threat landscape. In particular, the most active threat was [**Tycoon2FA**](https://any.run/malware-trends/tycoon/).

The top suspects among file types were: **executables, ZIP archives, PDFs, and emails (EML and MSG)**. A clear proof of how widespread both file- and email-based malware is.

But no threat should scare an analyst equipped with strong security solutions. Here are some of the tangible results reported by ANY.RUN’s users in 2025:

| Measurable impact with ANY.RUN, 2025 |
| --- |
|  |
| --- |
| Average MTTD: 15 seconds |
| MTTR reduced by: 21 minutes |
| Investigation speed improved: in 95% of SOCs |

This is a solid proof of the fact that our malware analysis and threat intelligence solutions change SOC workflows for the better.

## **Key Sandbox Updates: Driving Malware Analysis Forward**

### **More Ways to Run Malware**

This year we broadened the sandbox horizons by adding new operating systems to our VM for more flexible and realistic environments.

For teams tackling mobile threats, we introduced[**Android support**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/android-malware-analysis/). It gives you the opportunity to upload, interact, and analyze APK files in ANY.RUN’s virtual machine closely replicating a real Android device. Great timing, since mobile threats have been pretty active this year! But more on that below.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-4-2048x1137-1-1024x569.png)

We also added [**Linux Debian OS**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/arm-linux-malware-sandbox/), helping you detonate ARM-based threats. Since 2025, you can do full-scale malware built for IoT devices and other ARM systems in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox.
