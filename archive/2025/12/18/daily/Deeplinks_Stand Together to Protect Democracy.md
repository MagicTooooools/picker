What a year it’s been. We’ve seen technology unfortunately misused to supercharge the threats facing democracy: dystopian surveillance, attacks on encryption, and government censorship. These aren’t abstract dangers. They’re happening now, to real people, in real time.

EFF’s lawyers, technologists, and activists are pushing back. [But we need you in this fight.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/year-end-challenge--D)

[JOIN EFF TODAY!](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/year-end-challenge--D)

MAKE A YEAR END DONATION—HELP EFF UNLOCK CHALLENGE GRANTS!

If you [donate to EFF before the end of 2025](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/year-end-challenge--D), you’ll help fuel the legal battles that defend encryption, the tools that protect privacy, and the advocacy that stops dangerous laws—and you’ll help unlock up to $26,200 in challenge grants.

## 📣 Stand Together: That's How We Win 📣

The past year confirmed how urgently we need technologies that protect us, not surveil us. EFF has been in the fight every step of the way, [thanks to support from people like you.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/year-end-challenge--D)

This year alone EFF:

* Launched a resource hub to help users understand and fight back against **age verification laws**.
* Challenged San Jose's **unconstitutional license plate reader database**in court.
* Sued demanding answers when **ICE spotting apps** were mysteriously taken offline.
* Launched Rayhunter to detect **cell site simulators**.
* Pushed back hard against the EU's Chat Proposal that would **break encryption for millions**.

After 35 years of defending digital freedoms, we know what's at stake: we must protect your ability to speak freely, organize safely, and use technology without surveillance.

We have opportunities to win these fights, and you make each victory possible. [Donate to EFF by December 31](https://supporters...
