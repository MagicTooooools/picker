This week's ThreatsDay Bulletin tracks how attackers keep reshaping old tools and finding new angles in familiar systems. Small changes in tactics are stacking up fast, and each one hints at where the next big breach could come from.

From shifting infrastructures to clever social hooks, the week's activity shows just how fluid the threat landscape has become.

Here's the full rundown of what moved in the cyber world this week.

1. International scam ring busted

   [Fraudulent Call Centers Disrupted in Ukraine](https://policie.gov.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-operace-octopus-a-connect.aspx)

   Authorities from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine, along with Eurojust, [took action](https://policie.gov.cz/clanek/mezinarodni-operace-octopus-a-connect.aspx) against a criminal network operating call centers in Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Kyiv that scammed more than 400 victims across Europe out of more than €10 million ($11.7 million). "The criminal group established a professional organisation with employees who received a percentage of the proceeds for each completed scam," Eurojust [said](https://www.eurojust.europa.eu/news/fraudulent-call-centres-ukraine-rolled). "The fraudsters used various scams, such as posing as police officers to withdraw money using their victims' cards and details, or pretending that their victims' bank accounts had been hacked. They convinced their victims to transfer large sums of money from their 'compromised' bank accounts to 'safe' bank accounts controlled by the network. They also lured victims into downloading remote access software and entering their banking details, enabling the criminal group to access and control the victims' bank accounts." The call centers employed approximately 100 people and were recruited from the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and other countries. They played different roles, ranging from making calls and forging official certificates from the police and banks to collecting cash from their victims. Employees who successfully managed to obtain money from their victims would receive up to 7% of the proceeds to encourage them to continue the scam. The criminal enterprise also promised cash bonuses, cars, or apartments in Kyiv for employees who obtained more than €100,000. The operation led to the arrest of 12 suspects on December 9, 2025. Authorities also seized cash, 21 vehicles, and various weapons and ammunition.
2. UK nudity filter push

   [U.K. to Encourage Apple and Google to Put Nudity-Blocking Systems on Phones](https://www.ft.com/content/0ef79775-eadf-4cc9-b32c-e97b0eff816f)

   The U.K. government reportedly will "encourage" Apple and Google to prevent phones from displaying nude images except when users verify that they are adults. According to a new report from The Financial Times, the push for nudity-detection won't be a legal requirement "for now," but is said to be part of the government's strategy to tackle violence against women and girls. "The U.K. government wants technology companies to block explicit images on phones and computers by default to protect children, with adults having to verify their age to create and access such content," the report [said](https://www.ft.com/content/0ef79775-eadf-4cc9-b32c-e97b0eff816f). "Ministers want the likes of Apple and Google to incorporate nudity-detection algorithms into their device operating systems to prevent users from taking photos or sharing images of genitalia unless they are verified as adults."
3. Modular infostealer emerges

   [New SantaStealer Spotted](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-santastealer-is-coming-to-town-a-new-ambitious-infostealer-advertised-on-underground-forums/)

   A new, modular information stealer named SantaStealer is being advertised by Russian-speaking operators on Telegram and underground forums like Lolz. "The malware collects and exfiltrates sensitive documents, credentials, wallets, and data from a broad range of applications, and aims to operate entirely in-memory to avoid file-based detection," Rapid7 [said](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-santastealer-is-coming-to-town-a-new-ambitious-infostealer-advertised-on-underground-forums/). "Stolen data is then compressed, split into 10 MB chunks, and sent to a C2 server over unencrypted HTTP." SantaStealer uses 14 distinct data-collection modules, each running in its own thread and exfiltrating the stolen information. It also uses an embedded DLL to bypass Chrome's app-bound encryption protections and harvest browser credentials, including passwords, cookies, and saved credit cards from the web browser. Assessed to be a rebranding of BluelineStealer, the malware is available for $175 per month for a basic plan and $300 per month for a premium plan that lets customers edit execution delays and enable clipper functionality to substitute wallet addresses copied to the clipboard with an attacker-controlled one to reroute transactions. The threat actor has been active on Telegram since at least July 2025.
4. Bulletproof hosting exposed

   [Deep Dive on BPH Providers](https://www.silentpush.com/white-papers-and-reports/bph-white-paper-2025/)

   Threat actors leveraging Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) providers move faster than defenders can respond, often migrating operations, re-registering domains, and re-establishing services within hours of takedowns, Silent Push said in a new exhaustive analysis of BPH services. "Without knowledge of where this infrastructure shifts, takedowns lack the ...
