## Detailed Introduction

OpenSandbox is a universal sandbox platform for AI application scenarios. It provides safe, consistent, and extensible runtime environments to execute LLM-related capabilities such as command execution, file operations, code execution, browser automation, and more. The project includes multi-language SDKs, a unified sandbox protocol specification, and multiple sandbox runtime implementations to help developers run tools, plugins, or agents in controlled environments.

## Main Features

* Multi-language SDKs: Client SDKs for Python, Java, TypeScript (TBD) and other languages to integrate sandbox capabilities across ecosystems.
* Unified Protocol: OpenAPI-based sandbox protocol specifications under `specs/`, enabling custom runtime extensions.
* Rich Examples: Built-in sandbox implementations and examples for code interpreters, browser automation, filesystem operations, and more.
* Extensible Runtimes: Supports local Docker execution and plans for Kubernetes cluster execution for production scenarios.

## Use Cases

* Run LLM-driven code interpreters or toolchains inside isolated sandboxes to prevent external side effects.
* Provide a safe runtime for third-party plugins in platforms or applications.
* Use in automated testing, browser automation, remote development (VS Code Web), and desktop sandboxed environments.

## Technical Features

* OpenAPI-first: Defines sandbox lifecycle and capability APIs using OpenAPI, lowering integration barriers.
* Modular components: Executor, filesystem, and command components are modular and replaceable for customization.
* Examples and docs: `examples/` and `docs/` include practical integrations and architectural guidance for engineering adoption.
