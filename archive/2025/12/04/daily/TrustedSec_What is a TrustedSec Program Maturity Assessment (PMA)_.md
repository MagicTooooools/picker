The TrustedSec PMA is a tactical approach to evaluating the components, efficiency, and overall maturity of an organization’s Information Security program.

Unlike a traditional compliance audit, the PMA is designed as a strategic business enabler that ensures a security program is strong, adaptive, and resilient. Drawing on best practices from numerous frameworks, plus over a decade of real-world security assessment experience, TrustedSec identifies where your program is strong, where it is vulnerable, and what steps will provide the highest risk reduction and business impact.

## Benefits of a PMA

In cybersecurity, standing still is falling behind. Threats evolve daily from ransomware and supply chain compromises to insider risks, and it is essential to continuously evaluate an organization's security posture to ensure it is both technically sound and strategically aligned.

All organizations and their needs are different, which means a one-size-fits-all approach is typically not the best option. TrustedSec solves this by evaluating each organization’s mission, priorities, and current security posture and delivering a set of prioritized recommendations and associated remediation roadmaps that best fit the organization’s needs to minimize risks and safeguard sensitive data.

Benefits include:

1. **Identify Strengths and Weaknesses:** Assessments help pinpoint areas of excellence and those needing improvement, as well as help gain an understanding of the current security posture.
2. **Mitigate Risks:** Identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited by bad actors.
3. **Enhance Compliance:** PMAs can be combined with additional assessments to ensure alignment with industry frameworks and standards or regulations such as NIST CSF, CIS critical Security Controls, and ISO 27001.
4. **Demonstrate Accountability:** Build trust with company stakeholders by showcasing a commitment to robust cybersecurity practices.
5. **Support Decision-Making:** Results from these assessments provide data-driven insights to guide strategic and operational decisions, as well as support the need for purchasing technological tools and/or services.
6. **Improve Performance:** By identifying gaps, organizations can take corrective actions to enhance security program efficiency and business resilience.
7. **Benchmark Progress:** Maturity models often provide benchmarks that allow organizations to compare their progress against industry standards and past assessments.

## Key Components and Control Areas

TrustedSec has created the PMA framework based on what we look for in a strong and efficient security program.

The framework starts with the three (3) primary pillars—Enterprise Risk Management, Policy & Standards, and Information Security Architecture. These pillars are supported...
