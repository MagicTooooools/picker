A teenage cybercriminal posts a smug screenshot to mock a sextortion scammer… and accidentally hands over the keys to his real-world identity. Meanwhile, we look into the crystal ball for 2026 and consider how stolen data is now the jet fuel of cybercrime – and how next year could be even nastier than 2025.

Plus, Graham rants about recipe sites that won’t shut up, and there’s even more love for Lily Allen’s album “West End Girl” album.

All this and more is discussed in episode 446 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Rik Ferguson.
