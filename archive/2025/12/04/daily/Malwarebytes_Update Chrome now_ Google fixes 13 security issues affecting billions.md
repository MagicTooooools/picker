# Update Chrome now: Google fixes 13 security issues affecting billions

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 4, 2025

![Chrome logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/Chrome-1200.png?w=1200)

Google has [released an update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) for its Chrome browser that includes 13 security fixes, four of which are classified as high severity. One of these was found in Chrome’s Digital Credentials feature–a tool that lets you share verified information from your digital wallet with websites so you can prove who you are across devices.

Chrome is by far the world’s most popular browser, with an estimated 3.4 billion users. That scale means when Chrome has a security flaw, billions of users are potentially exposed until they update.

That’s why it’s important to install these patches promptly. Staying unpatched means you could be at risk just by browsing the web, and attackers often exploit these kinds of flaws before most users have a chance to update. Always let your browser update itself, and don’t delay restarting the browser as updates usually fix exactly this kind of risk.

## How to update Chrome

The latest version number is **143.0.7499.40/.4**1 for Windows and macOS, and **143.0.7499.40** for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on version **143.0.7499.40 or later,** it’s protected from these vulnerabilities.

The easiest way to update is to allow Chrome to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.

To update manually, click the **More** menu (three dots), then go to **Settings** > **About Chrome**. If an update is available, Chrome will start downloading it. Restart Chrome to complete the update, and you’ll be protected against these vulnerabilities.

You can also find step-by-step instructions in our guide to [how to update Chrome on every operating system](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/explained/2025/06/how-to-update-chrome-on-every-operating-system).

## Technical details

One of the vulnerabilities was found in the Digital Credentials feature and is tracked as [**CVE-2025-13633**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13633). As usual Google is keeping the details sparse until most users have updated. The description says:

> Use after free in Digital Credentials in Google Chrome prior to 143.0.7499.41 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

That sounds complicated so let’s break it down.

**Use after free (UAF)** is a specific type of software vulnerability where a program attempts to access a memory location after it has been freed. That can lead to crashes or, in some cases, let an attackers run their own code.

**The renderer process** is the part of modern browsers like Chrome that turns HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into the visible webpage you see in a tab. It’s sandboxed for safety, separate from the browser’s main “browser process” that manages tabs, URLs, and network requests. So, for HTML pages, this is essentially the browser’s webpage display engine.

**The heap** is an area of memory made available for use by the program. The program can request blocks of memory for its use within the heap. In order to allocate a block of some size, the program make...
