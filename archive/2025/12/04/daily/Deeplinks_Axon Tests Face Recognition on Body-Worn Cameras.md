Axon Enterprise Inc. is working with a Canadian police department to test the addition of [face recognition technology (FRT)](https://sls.eff.org/technologies/face-recognition) to its body-worn cameras ([BWCs](https://sls.eff.org/technologies/body-worn-cameras)). This is an alarming development in government surveillance that should put communities everywhere on alert.

As many as 50 officers from the Edmonton Police Department (EPD) will begin using these FRT-enabled BWCs today as part of a proof-of-concept experiment. EPD is the first police department in the world to use these Axon devices, according to [a report from the Edmonton Journal](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/edmonton-police-first-world-test-axon-facial-recognition-body-worn-cameras).

This kind of technology could give officers instant identification of any person that crosses their path. During the current trial period, the Edmonton officers will not be notified in the field of an individual’s identity but will review identifications generated by the BWCs later on.

“This Proof of Concept will test the technology’s ability to work with our database to make officers aware of individuals with safety flags and cautions from previous interactions,” as well as “individuals who have outstanding warrants for serious crime,” Edmonton Police described in a [press release](https://edmonton.citynews.ca/2025/12/02/edmonton-police-testing-facial-recognition-bodycams/), suggesting that individuals will be placed on a watchlist of sorts.

FRT brings a rash of problems. It relies on extensive surveillance and collecting images on individuals, law-abiding or otherwise.

In a world where police are using real-time face recognition, law-abiding individuals or those participating in legal, prot...
