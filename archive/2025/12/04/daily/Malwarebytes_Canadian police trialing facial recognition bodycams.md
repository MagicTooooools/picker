# Canadian police trialing facial recognition bodycams

by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury) |
December 4, 2025

![facial recognition](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/facial-recognition.jpg?w=1200)

A municipal police force in Canada is now using facial recognition bodycams, it was revealed this week. The police service in the prairie city of Edmonton is trialing technology from US-based [Axon](https://www.axon.com), which makes products for the military and law enforcement.

Up to 50 officers are taking part in the trial this month, [according to reports](https://therecord.media/canadian-police-department-trials-facial-recognition-body-cameras). Officers won’t turn the cameras on in the field until they’re actively investigating or enforcing, representatives from Axon [said](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-police-facial-recognition-cameras-9.7000389).

When the cameras are activated, the recognition software will run in the background, not reporting anything to the wearer. The camera captures images of anyone within roughly four feet of the officer and sends them to a cloud service, where it will be compared against 6,341 people already flagged in the police system. According to police and Axon, images that don’t match the list will be deleted, and the database is entirely owned by the Police Service, meaning that Axon doesn’t get to see it.

This represents a turnaround for Axon. In 2019, its first ethics board [report](https://www.policingproject.org/axon-fr) said that facial recognition wasn’t reliable enough for body cameras.

CEO Rick Smith [said](https://www.axon.com/news/ai-ethics-board-report) at the time:

> “Current face matching technology raises serious ethical concerns. In addition, there are technological limitations to using this technology on body cameras. Consistent with the board’s recommendation, Axon will not be commercializing face matching products on our body cameras at this time.”

Two years later, nine of the board’s members [resigned](https://www.policingproject.org/statement-of-resigning-axon-ai-ethics-board-members) after the company reportedly went against their recommendations by pursuing plans for taser-equipped drones. Axon subsequently [put the drone project on hold](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/06/1103285030/axon-halts-plans-for-taser-drone-as-9-on-ethics-board-resign).

Gideon Christian, an associated law professor at the University of Calgary (in Alberta, the same province as Edmonton), [told Yahoo News](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/edmonton-police-first-world-test-173254575.html) that the Edmonton Police Service’s move would transform bodycams from a tool making police officers accountable to a tool of mass surveillance:

> “This tool is basically now being thrown from a tool for police accountability and transparency to a tool for mass surveillance of members of the public.”

## Policy spaghetti in the US and further afield

This wouldn’t be the first time that police have tried facial recognition, often with lamentable results. The American Civil Liberties Union [identified](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/police-say-a-simple-warning-will-prevent-face-recognition-wrongful-arrests-thats-just-not-true) at least seven wrongful arrests in the US thanks to inaccurate facial recognition results, and that was in April 2024. Most if not all of those incidents involved black people, it said. Facial recognition datasets have been found to be [racially biased](https://archive.ph/EVj0y).

In June 2024, police in Detroit [agreed](https://quadrangle.michigan.law.umich.edu/issue...
