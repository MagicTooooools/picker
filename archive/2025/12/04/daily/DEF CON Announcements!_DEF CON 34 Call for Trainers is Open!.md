**Call for Trainers: DEF CON Training Las Vegas 2026**

**Event Description**

Dates: August 8-11, 2026 (note: most courses will run August 10-11, 2026)
Location: Las Vegas Convention Center (likely West Hall)

DEF CON has been one of the world’s leading cybersecurity communities for more than three decades, known for convening industry, government, and independent experts to exchange advanced knowledge and practical skills. Building on this tradition, DEF CON Training delivers intensive courses taught by recognized global instructors. DEF CON Training courses offer hands-on instruction in a challenging, fast-paced environment.

This August, training will run alongside and after DEF CON 34. Most courses will be two days and will run August 10-11. There will be limited opportunities for four-day courses August 8-11 or two-day courses August 8-9.

**Course Guidelines**

Courses should be two or four days long, providing about 8 hours of content per day. This timing should include any exams or capstone activities.

Strong applications will include all information requested in the application below and will include novel approaches or unique topics, especially those that have not been offered at other recent DEF CON Training sessions or similar events. For courses hoping to run concurrently with DEF CON (August 8-9), preference will be given to those who can demonstrate alignment with and use of DEF CON programming, such as through collaborations with or field trips to DEF CON Villages.

All submissions, including those from returning trainers, will be evaluated by the training review board through a competitive process. Accepted courses will be posted on the DEF CON Training website. DEF CON Training will provide promotion and administrative support. Gross revenue for each course will be split evenly (50% to each party) between DEF CON Training and the trainer(s), based on the price set together.

Courses may be reviewed on a rolling basis, so you are encouraged to apply early and to check training.defcon.org for course postings to ensure you do not submit a duplicate of an accepted course.

Trainers who submitted to the DEF CON Singapore CFT and indicated they would like to be reviewed for Las Vegas 2026 do not need to resubmit. Email training@defcon.org with any questions or if you would like to provide supplements to your submission.

**Submission Instructions**

Please email your completed application or any questions to training@defcon.org. Submissions can be included in the body of an email or as an attachment and should follow the format laid out below.

We will acknowledge receipt of all materials with an email reply. If you do not receive an email reply within 48 hours of submission, please send a follow up to confirm your materials were received.
