Think your Wi-Fi is safe? Your coding tools? Or even your favorite financial apps? This week proves again how hackers, companies, and governments are all locked in a nonstop race to outsmart each other.

Here's a quick rundown of the latest cyber stories that show how fast the game keeps changing.

1. DeFi exploit drains funds

   [Critical yETH Exploit Used to Steal $9M](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/16-wei/)

   A critical exploit targeting Yearn Finance's yETH pool on Ethereum has been exploited by unknown threat actors, resulting in the theft of approximately $9 million from the protocol. The attack is said to have abused a flaw in how the protocol manages its internal accounting, stemming from the fact that a cache containing calculated values to save on gas fees was never cleared when the pool was completely emptied. "The attacker achieved this by minting an astronomical number of tokens – 235 septillion yETH (a 41-digit number) – while depositing only 16 wei, worth approximately $0.000000000000000045," Check Point [said](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/16-wei/). "This represents one of the most capital-efficient exploits in DeFi history."
2. Linux malware evolves stealth

   [New Symbiote and BPFDoor Variants Spotted](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-ebpf-filters-for-symbiote-and-bpfdoor-malware)

   Fortinet said it discovered 151 new samples of [BPFDoor](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/new-bpfdoor-controller-enables-stealthy.html) and three of [Symbiote](https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/symbiote-stealthy-linux-malware.html) exploiting extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPFs) to enhance stealth through IPv6 support, UDP traffic, and dynamic port hopping for covert command-and-control (C2) communication. In the case of Symbiote, the BPF instructions show the new variant only accepts IPv4 or IPv6 packets for protocols TCP, UDP, and SCTP on non-standard ports 54778, 58870, 59666, 54879, 57987, 64322, 45677, and 63227. Coming to BPFDoor, the newly identified artifacts have been found to support both IPv4 and IPv6, as well as switch to a completely different magic packet mechanism. "Malware authors are enhancing their BPF filters to increase their chances of evading detection. Symbiote uses port hopping on UDP high ports, and BPFDoor implements IPv6 support," security researcher Axelle Apvrille [said](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-ebpf-filters-for-symbiote-and-bpfdoor-malware).
3. Phishing blitz blocked

   [Microsoft Blocks Storm-0900 Phishing Campaign](https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1995649234264076460)

   Microsoft said it detected and blocked on November 26, 2025, a high-volume phishing campaign from a threat actor named Storm-0900. "The campaign used parking ticket and medical test result themes and referenced Thanksgiving to lend credibility and lower recipients' suspicion," it [said](https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1995649234264076460). "The campaign consisted of tens of thousands of emails and targeted primarily users in the United States." The URLs redirected to an attacker-controlled landing page that first required users to solve a slider CAPTCHA by clicking and dragging a slider, followed by [ClickFix](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/clickfix-malware-campaign-exploits.html), which tricked users into running a malicious PowerShell script under the guise of completing a verification step. The end goal of the attacks was to deliver a modular malware known as [XWorm](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/xworm-60-returns-with-35-plugins-and.html) that enables remote access, data theft, and deployment of additional payloads. "Storm-0900 is a prolific threat actor that, when active, launches phishing campaigns every week," Microsoft said.
4. Grant scam hides malware

   [ClickFix Campaign Delivers Stealerium Infostealer](https://x.com/SpiderLabs/status/1995639456028926169)

   A new phishing campaign has been observed distributing bogus emails claiming to be about a professional achievement grant that lures them with supposed monetary grants. "It includes a password-protected ZIP and personalized details to appear legitimate, urging the victim to open the attached 'secure digital package' to claim the award, setting up the credential phish and malware chain that follows," Trustwave [said](https://x.com/SpiderLabs/status/1995639456028926169). The ZIP archive contains an HTML page that's designed to phish their webmail credentials and exfiltrate it to a Telegram bot. Then a malicious SVG image is used to trigger a PowerShell ClickFix chain that installs the Stealerium infostealer to fix a purported issue with Google Chrome.
5. Russian spies hit NGOs

   [COLDRIVER Targets French NGO Reporters Without Borders](https://blog.sekoia.io/ngo-reporters-without-borders-targeted-by-calisto-in-recent-campaign/)

   A fresh wave of spear-phishing activity linked to the Russia-nexus intrusion set [COLDRIVER](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/google-identifies-three-new-russian.html) has targeted non-profit organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which was designated as an "undesirable" entity by the Kremlin in August 2025. The attack, observed in March 2025, originated from a Proton Mail address, urging targets to review a malicious document by sharing a link that likely redirected to a Proton Drive URL hosting a PDF file. In another case targeting a different victim, the PDF came attached to the email message. "The retrieved file is a typical Cal...
