Hi friends and welcome to the last post for this year! Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!

I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had [a few CVEs](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-11936/product_id-83493/Tp-link-Tapo-C200-Firmware.html) discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some **AI assisted reverse engineering** and test whether I could still find anything at all.

I documented the entire process live on [Arcadia](https://discord.com/channels/1100085665766572142/1396102661257957396) - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.

This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I *am* generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.

What started as a lazy weekend project turned into finding a few security vulnerabilities that affect about [25,000 of these devices directly exposed on the internet](https://www.zoomeye.ai/searchResult?q=IlRQUkktREVWSUNFIg==).

## Getting the Firmware

### Tools

* Old friend [JD-GUI](https://java-decompiler.github.io/) to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things
* [The AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to download the firmware image.
* [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) for firmware inspection.
* [Grok](https://grok.com) to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.

The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some [basic reversing](/2017/04/27/Android-Applications-Reversing-101/) of the [Tapo Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.iot&hl=it), I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $ aws s3 ls s3://download.tplinkcloud.com/ --no-sign-request --recursive ``` |

[The entire output is here, for the curious](/images/2025/tapo/bucket_contents.txt). This provides access to the firmware image of every TP-Link device - routers, cameras, smart plugs, you name it. A reverse engineer’s candy store.

I grabbed version **1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n** for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named `Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin`, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.

And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to [do some deep research](https://x.com/i/grok/share/t9RzvgCRwIluVGnXMu39VVxDx) on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:

### Decrypting the Firmware

### Tools

* The [tp-link-decrypt](https://github.com/robbins/tp-link-decrypt) tool to decrypt the firmware image.
* [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) for firmware inspection.

Thanks to Grok, the [tp-link-decrypt](https://github.com/robbins/tp-link-decrypt) tool and the fact that every firmware image for every device seems to be encrypted the same exact way, we can now decrypt the firmware. The tool extracts RSA keys from TP-Link’s own GPL code releases - they publish the decryption keys themselves as part of their open source obligations.

Credits to @watchfulip for the [original extensive TP-Link firmware research](https://watchfulip.github.io/28-12-24/tp-link_c210_v2.html) and @tangrs for [finding that the relevant binaries are published in TP-Link GPL code dumps and how to extract keys from them](https://blog.tangrs.id.au/2025/09/22/decrypting-tplink-smart-switch-firmware/).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 ``` | ``` $ git clone https://github.com/robbins/tp-link-decrypt $ cd tp-link-decrypt $ ./preinstall.sh        # Install dependencies $ ./extract_keys.sh      # Extract RSA keys from TP-Link's GPL code $ make $ bin/tp-link-decrypt Tapo_C200_firmware.bin ``` |

After decryption, the firmware revealed a fairly standard structure: a bootloader, a kernel, and a SquashFS root filesystem.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ``` 1 ``` | ``` $ binwalk -e Tapo_C200_v3_1.4.2_decrypted.bin ``` |

## Hunting for Bugs

### Tools

* [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) to decompile and understand the MIPS binaries
* [GhidraMCP](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP) to let an AI connect to my running Ghidra instance and support me in the process.
* [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) to ask AI to explore the filesystem and find interesting components.
* A mix of [Anthropic's Opus and Sonnet 4](https://claude.ai/).

Once extracted, I used AI and Cline to explore the filesystem in search of which components handle the discovery protocol, camera web API, video streaming, etc all discovered earlier while reversing the Android app.
