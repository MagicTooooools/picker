# CISA warns ASUS Live Update backdoor is still exploitable, seven years on

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 19, 2025

![ASUS logo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ASUS_logo.png?w=1200)

Recently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/12/17/cisa-adds-three-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) (along with two others) a vulnerability in ASUS Live Update to its [catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

The KEV catalog lists vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited in the wild and sets patch deadlines for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies. When CISA adds an issue to this list, it’s a strong signal that exploitation is real, ongoing, and urgent.

The ASUS Live Update Embedded Malicious Code vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-59374](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59374) (with a [CVSS score](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/how-cvss-v4-0-works-characterizing-and-scoring-vulnerabilities) of 9.3), affects Live Update, a utility commonly used to deliver firmware and software updates to ASUS devices.

This isn’t the first time ASUS Live Update has been linked to serious security incidents. In 2019, ASUS responded to media reports about attacks on the Live Update tool by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, stating that:

> “A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group.”

Later investigations revealed that a sophisticated supply chain attack mounted in 2018, attributed to Chinese state-sponsored attackers, had inserted a backdoor into ASUS Live Update. The attack was particularly effective because that utility came preinstalled on most ASUS devices and was used to the automatically update BIOS, UEFI, drivers, and other components.

CISA now notes that the affected devices could be abused to perform unintended actions if certain conditions are met. Originally, the attackers reportedly targeted only around 600 specific devices, based on hashed MAC addresses hardcoded in various versions of the tool. This was despite the fact that millions of users may have downloaded the backdoored utility.

Support for the ASUS Live Update application [has since been discontinued](https://www.asus.com/us/support/faq/1018727/). The final intended version of ASUS Live Update was 3.6.15, but it will continue to provide software updates. This is likely why a CVE was assigned and why the vulnerability was added to the KEV catalog. There was no official “why now” statement from ASUS, MITRE, or CISA, but the timing aligns with a legacy, end-of-support product being reclassified as a vulnerability with confirmed active exploitation.

## What do ASUS users need to do?

First of all, make sure you’re running a clean version of the utility. ASUS urges users to update to version **3.6.8 or later** to address known security issues.
