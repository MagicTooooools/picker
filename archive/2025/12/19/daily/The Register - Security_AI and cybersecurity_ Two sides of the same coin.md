# AI and cybersecurity: Two sides of the same coin

## Practical lessons on securing AI and using AI to strengthen defence

Sponsored Post AI is moving from experimentation to everyday use inside the enterprise. That shift brings new opportunities, but it also changes the security equation. Attacks are becoming faster and more convincing, while organizations are simultaneously trying to protect new assets like models, prompts, agent workflows, and the sensitive data those systems can access.

In this on-demand webinar, The Register hosts a panel discussion that tackles the topic from both directions: AI for cybersecurity, and cybersecurity for AI. The session brings together perspectives from Google Cloud, Deloitte, and IDC, covering what leaders are seeing in the field and what that means for day-to-day decision-making.

Across the conversation, you will hear why AI and security budgets often rise to the top together, even when budgets are under pressure. You will also get a grounded view of what is driving security teams to rethink operations, including growing ransomware and nation state-sponsored activity, the rising cost of defense, and the ongoing shortage of skilled SOC analysts.

The panel explores how AI can help reduce fatigue by summarizing alerts, prioritizing what matters, and supporting analysts with repetitive work. It also examines what changes when agentic tools enter the picture, from access control to governance, and why shadow AI is as much a cultural issue as a technology one.

You will come away with practical considerations for:

* Choosing sensible AI security use cases that support humans, rather than promising full autonomy overnight
* Building governance that enables safe adoption instead of driving unsanctioned workarounds
* Thinking through model risk, including prompt injection, data exposure, and the integrity of output...
