## AI Advertising Company Hacked

At least some of this is [coming to light](https://www.404media.co/hack-reveals-the-a16z-backed-phone-farm-flooding-tiktok-with-ai-influencers/):

> Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company.
>
> The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company’s backend, including the phone farm itself.

@ Bruce,

The link you give is “firewalled” for “payed members only”.

It appears from a Duckduck search that a similar article can be read at,

I’m not on TikTok, but TikTok says the flagged accounts are now labelled as being AI-generated.

TikTok’s Community Guidelines are super interesting.

404 Media links to the section on ‘Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)’

<https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en/integrity-authenticity#3>

Really basically, and I hope I have this right, creators need to label AI-gen content showing people. They also prohibit content that is misleading about matters of public importance or harmful to individuals. The details therein matter a lot (toggle More information) and I’d *love* to see their review process.

So, if the Social Media industry is corrupt, and

Yet another case of technical solutions not working for a social problem.

@ lurker, Bruce, ALL,

**Is the web becoming of less interest than politics?**

It’s actually a relevant question here as the Internet income is predicated on “eyes on adverts” actually becoming sales.

If people that control personal budgets loose interest in the Internet, then sales will actually be hit disproportionately fast in a less than zero wage rise and falling employment opportunity economy.

Normally I’d pop this on the Friday Squid, but as I’ve said it’s relevant here.

> **Faith in the internet is fading among young Brits**
>
> “*Ofcom survey finds 18-34s increasingly see life online as bad for society and their mental health*
>
> The UK’s communications regulator found that in June 2025, just a third of those aged 18-34 agreed the internet is good for society, down from 42 percent a year earlier. While this fell for older age groups as well, it did so less sharply (34 percent versus 38 percent in 2024), meaning those aged 55 and above are proportionately more positive than younger people about the internet’s impact on civilization.“

<https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/19/internet_bad_for_society/>

Thus it’s not just “falling eyeball count” but “disenchanted eyeball increase” as well.

Thus this Venture Capital Funded startup is not just running out of moat / runway it’s potential clients are not going to be seeing returns expected / promised.

Thus the question that has to be asked,

“Is this a good thing or a bad thing?”

The answer to which very much depends on your point of view.

For the social element of society I would say it’s good news. As the Social Networking Mega-Corps will get hit and their ability to purchase influence will decrease probably faster than their ad based income.

Will it reduce “enshitification” initially no it will get worse as those dependent on ad income double down. But in the longer term the web will move to new business models or in effect go bankrupt at the server end.

Unfortunately that will also help authoritarian politicians and their guard labour. Because one thing that will happen is major services will become “Pay to Play” and very very few are actually worth signing up to “Government backed Surveillance” for. Which will further reduce the “eye balls on ads”.

It will also effect politics, not just the dirty money flows endemic in many so called democracies but the ability to reach eye balls at minimum cost and convenience.

But the one thing that almost certainly will be true is based on the old observation of,

“You Can’t go back”

Especially true when it comes to “harms” of any kind, they’ve happened and the scars will go to the grave with many. All that is gained is caution and lessons to teach.

This fake influencers VC backed startup is not just breaking terms and conditions of Companies… In some jurisdictions it’s committing fraud.

For those in the UK look at the three types of fraud outlined in Sub section 2 of Section 1 of the fraud act,

<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/1>

It could be fairly said a case could be made under all three types of fraud…
