## Detailed Introduction

AEnvironment is a standardized environment infrastructure for agentic AI development, designed to provide researchers and engineers with reproducible, orchestratable, and measurable runtime environments. It unifies simulation, sandboxing, and benchmarking workflows to reduce the cost of transferring agents between environments or reproducing experiments, and supports modular task and observation interfaces.

## Main Features

* Standardized environment interfaces for easy integration with a variety of agents and evaluation frameworks.
* Support for sandbox and simulator scenarios for safe testing and behavior observation.
* A benchmark-ready evaluation toolchain for comparing performance and robustness.
* Modular and extensible design that enables plugin-style capability expansion.

## Use Cases

* Simulation experiments for training and evaluating autonomous decision-making agents.
* Replay and reproduce agent behaviors inside isolated sandboxes for safety and compliance testing.
* Build cross-project benchmark suites to compare strategies, models, and environment combinations.

## Technical Features

* Released under the Apache-2.0 license for easy reuse in research and engineering projects.
* Modular architecture supporting multiple observation/execution interfaces and custom tasks.
* Designed for observability and benchmarked measurement to collect metrics and enable comparative analysis.
* Documentation and examples to help users get started quickly and reproduce experiments in real scenarios.
