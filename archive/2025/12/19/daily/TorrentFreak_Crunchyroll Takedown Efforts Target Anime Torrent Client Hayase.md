# Crunchyroll Takedown Efforts Target Anime Torrent Client Hayase

Hayase is a full-featured torrent streaming client optimized for anime content. The developer tried to stay clear of legal trouble by relying on user-installed extensions. However, MarkScan, the takedown partner of anime giant Crunchyroll, insists that the app is copyright infringing as it "enables unauthorized access to anime content". Despite these and various other takedown efforts, Hayase is largely unaffected.

The standalone torrent client, formerly known as Miru, offers a clean and organized media player interface to stream anime content.

The torrent streaming functionality is similar to the likes of [Popcorn Time](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/popcorn-time/), while Hayase’s reliance on third-party extensions is reminiscent of [Kodi](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/kodi/). On the [official GitHub page](https://github.com/hayase-app), the dev team bills its multi-platform software as a *bring-your-own-content* streaming tool.

“Hayase is a bring-your-own-content torrent streaming client designed for anime enthusiasts. It provides the technology to stream torrents in real-time, with no waiting for downloads to finish,’ they write.

The decision not to include any content is in part legally driven. After all, most anime torrent sources rely on pirated content. These third-party sources are something Hayase explicitly distances itself from in a disclaimer.

“Hayase is purely a torrent client and media player. It does not provide, index, host, or link to any content sources, torrent files, or unofficial repositories. Users are fully responsible for sourcing their own content legally and in compliance with their local laws.”

*Disclaimer*

## Crunchyroll Asks GitHub to Take Action

While Hayase does not host or link to any infringing content, many users configure it as a pirate streaming anime player. This is a thorn in the side of rightsholders including the American subscription service Crunchyroll, which would rather see it gone.

Through their Indian takedown partner, MarkScan, Crunchyroll recently asked GitHub to remove links to various Hayase releases. Notably, the notice cites Indian IT regulations alongside U.S. copyright law to support its demands.

The takedown notice

“This notice is to bring to your attention that we have found copyright infringement on the application named ‘Hayase’ that is using your services,” MarkScan [writes](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2025/12/2025-12-15-crunchyroll.md).

“Hayase enables unauthorized access to anime content, an activity which is well established as copyright infringement under applicable laws and relevant case law,” the notice adds.

Crunchyroll’s DMCA notice requests the removal of nearly two dozen URLs but provides no detail on the alleged infringements. Instead, it refers to screenshots in Appendix B, which are not included in the publicly posted notice.

## Hayase Takes Action

Speaking with TorrentFreak, the Hayase team notes that GitHub did not send them the references appendix. This means that the developers also have no clue what the alleged infringements are. Consequently, they lack the required information to file a proper counter-notice.

Hayase’s developers could, in theory, try to follow this up with GitHub. However, instead of dragging the matter out, the team simply chose to remove the contested files. These URLs all point to 404 errors now, so GitHub was not required to take action.

The removals don’t appear to impact Hayase, as the links are no longer actively used as live download links on the [official website](https://hayase.watch/). Also, it’s worth noting that even if the entire GitHub repository is removed, installed applications would still work.

## Google Play, Discord, and Other Takedown Attempts

Given recent history, it is likely that this won’t be Crunchyroll’s last attempt to disrupt Hayase. Previously, its takedown partner MarkScan sent a DMCA takedown notice to GitHub [in October](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2025/10/2025-10-22-crunchyroll.md).

Hayase has also been targeted outside of GitHub. On Discord, for example, various messages in the channel were removed for alleged copyright infringement. Whether Crunchyroll is behind these takedowns is unknown, as Discord did not share that information.

The most problematic takedown effort targeted Google Play, where it was indeed removed. The Play Store was the go-to destination for many Android users to download the app. While these people can still download the Hayase APK on the official site, that’s a hurdle for some.

With recently announced changes at Crunchyroll, anti-piracy enforcement will arguably become even more important in the new year. At the end of 2025, Crunchyroll will officially discontinue its free ad-supported service, presumably to convert more fans into paying customers.

Ironically, however, one of the most popular reactions to the news, which generated over [5 million views on X](https://x.com/JaekyTV/status/1997898795200458921), mentions Hayase as something worth looking into.

*Work to do…*
