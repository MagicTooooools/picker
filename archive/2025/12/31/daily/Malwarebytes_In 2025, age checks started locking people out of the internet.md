# In 2025, age checks started locking people out of the internet

by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp) |
December 31, 2025

![VPN to view adult content](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Adults_only.png?w=1200)

If 2024 was the year lawmakers talked about online age verification, 2025 was the year they actually flipped the switch.​

In 2025, across parts of Europe and the US, age checks for certain websites (especially pornography) turned long‑running child‑protection debates into real‑world access controls. Overnight, users found entire categories of sites locked behind ID checks, platforms geo‑blocking whole countries, and [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) traffic surging as people tried to get around the new walls.​

From [France’s hardline stance on adult sites](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/pornhub-redtube-and-youporn-block-access-in-france-vpn-use-set-to-soar) to the UK’s [Online Safety](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/internet-safety-tips) Act, to a patchwork of new rules across multiple US states, these “show me your ID before you browse” systems are reshaping the web. The stated goal is to “protect the children,” but in practice the outcome is frequently a blunt national block, followed by users [voting with their VPN buttons](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/vpn-use-rises-following-online-safety-acts-age-verification-controls).​

## The core tension: safety vs privacy

The fundamental challenge for websites and services is not checking age in principle, but how to do it without [turning everyday browsing into an identity check](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/10-not-so-hidden-dangers-age-verification). Almost every viable method asks users to hand over sensitive data, raising the stakes if (or more likely when) that [data leaks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) in a breach.​

For ordinary users, the result is a confusing mess of blocks, prompts, and workarounds. On paper, countries want better protection for minors. In practice, adults discover that entire platforms are unavailable unless they are prepared to disclose [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) or disguise where they connect from. No website wants to be the one blamed after an age‑verification database is compromised, yet regulators continue to push for stronger identity links.​

## How age checks actually work

Regulators such as [Ofcom publish lists of acceptable age‑verification methods](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/implementing-the-online-safety-act-protecting-children), each with its own privacy and usability trade‑offs. None are perfect, and many shift risk from governments and platforms onto users’ most sensitive personal data.​

* **Facial age estimation**: Users upload a selfie or short video so an algorithm can guess whether they look over 18, which avoids storing documents but relies on sensitive biometrics and imperfect accuracy.​
* **Open banking:** An age‑check service queries your bank for a simple “adult or not” answer. It may be convenient on paper but it’s a hard sell when the relying site is an adult platform.​
* **Digital identity services:** Digital ID wallets can assert “over 18” without exposing full credentials, but they add yet another app and infrastructure layer that must be trusted and widely adopted.​
* **Credit card checks:** Using a valid payment card as a [proxy](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersec...
