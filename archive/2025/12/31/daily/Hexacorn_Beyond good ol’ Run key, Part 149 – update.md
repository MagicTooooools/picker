# Beyond good ol’ Run key, Part 149 – update

Posted on [2025-12-31](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/12/31/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-149-update/ "12:48 am")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

In my [older post](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/07/11/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-149/), I described the persistence mechanism (*GPExtensionDLL* Registry entry) that I couldn’t make to work at that time. I eventually found a way to trigger it, using a function *LoadGPExtensionDll* exported by the *fwpolicyiomgr.dll*.

One can execute:

```
rundll32.exe fwpolicyiomgr.dll, LoadGPExtensionDll
```

to load a DLL referenced by the following Registry entry:

```
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\mpssvc\Parameters\GPExtensionDLL=<DLL>
```
