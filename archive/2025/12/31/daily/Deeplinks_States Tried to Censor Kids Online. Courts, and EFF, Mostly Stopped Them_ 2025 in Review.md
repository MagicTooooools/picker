Lawmakers in at least a dozen states believe that they can pass laws blocking  young people from social media or require them to get their parents’ permission before logging on. Fortunately, nearly every trial court to review these laws has ruled that they are unconstitutional.

It’s not just courts telling these lawmakers they are wrong. EFF has spent the past year filing [friend-of-the-court briefs](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/eff-court-young-people-have-first-amendment-rights) in courts across the country explaining how these laws violate young people’s First Amendment rights to speak and get information online.

Minors have long had the same First Amendment rights as adults: to talk about politics, create art, comment on the news, discuss or practice religion, and more. The internet simply amplified their ability to speak, organize, and find community.

Although these state laws vary in scope, most have two core features. First, they require social media services to estimate or verify the ages of all users. Second, they either ban minor access to social media, or require parental permission.
