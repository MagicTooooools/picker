# A few thoughts closing out 2025

Prompted by participants, a few closing thoughts for 2025

As the very intense and sometimes demoralizing 2025 wraps up, I want to thank everyone who trusted us
to help with their threat modeling work. Many of you showed up eager to
learn, bringing real systems, real constraints, and questions you
were genuinely trying to answer. Those questions shaped the
trainings and the new course on Threat Modeling Using LLMs, and
they kept the work grounded in what people actually need when they
go back to their day jobs. Helping people meet the
material where they are and grow from there is the part
I take most seriously.

In December, we ran a training with [MxD](https://www.mxdusa.org/), and today
two participants wrote about their experiences, prompting this post. Nitin Uchel
drew on his years of experience delivering solutions to customers
to [explore how threat modeling connects with cognitive electronic
warfare](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7412151043918069760/). Angelika Szymanowska [wrote about her experience](https://medium.com/%40angelska327/threat-modeling-with-adam-shostack-200eec3b2693) in
the two-day workshop, describing how working through concrete
exercises like data-flow diagrams and attacker scenarios helped
her grasp core threat modeling questions. I appreciated reading
about how the deliberate pacing and clear explanations made the material accessible even when it got dense for her as a non-native English speaker.

We also ran the first version of *Threat Modeling Using LLMs* at OWASP Global AppSec. We’re still digesting what happened in that course, but one concrete outcome stood out. During the sessions, [Mike Ensing](https://github.com/ensingm2/) built [a set of rules and instructions](https://github.com/ensingm2/AI-threat-modeling-rulesets/)
as we worked through the material, using it to explore what was
and wasn’t effective. After the conference, he released the work
on GitHub and has continued to improve it. It’s a solid example of
how participants took the ideas from the course and turned them
into something concrete and useful.

What I saw this year were people trying to make the world a little
better. Often that meant designing and delivering better
systems. Participants brought hard questions, real tradeoffs, and
the constraints they face in their jobs into our courses. That
seriousness runs through everything we do. We don’t treat threat
modeling as an abstract exercise, but as a way to make clearer
decisions and improve what gets built. I’m grateful to everyone
who engaged at that level and carried the work back into how they deliver.

LLMs have a very weird idea of what snow is.
