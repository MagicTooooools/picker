As a tradition, we use the last day of the year to look back at some of the biggest stories of the past twelve months. However, since TorrentFreak just celebrated its 20th anniversary, we're zooming out even further, looking back at some of the key moments in the past two decades.

Therefore, it can be a good idea to stop and reflect now and then. After covering piracy news and copyright challenges for more than two decades, we look back at some of the most memorable moments.

This certainly isn’t an exhaustive list, but it surely shows that times have changed. And they continue to do so.
