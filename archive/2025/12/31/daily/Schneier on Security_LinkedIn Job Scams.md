## LinkedIn Job Scams

Interesting [article](https://restofworld.org/2025/linkedin-job-scams/) on the variety of LinkedIn job scams around the world:

> In India, tech jobs are used as bait because the industry employs millions of people and offers high-paying roles. In Kenya, the recruitment industry is largely unorganized, so scamsters leverage fake personal referrals. In Mexico, bad actors capitalize on the informal nature of the job economy by advertising fake formal roles that carry a promise of security. In Nigeria, scamsters often manage to get LinkedIn users to share their login credentials with the lure of paid work, preying on their desperation amid an especially acute unemployment crisis.

These are scams involving fraudulent employers convincing prospective employees to send them money for various fees. There is an entirely different set of scams involving fraudulent employees getting hired for remote jobs.

Yet another wrapper for advance fee fraud. Easier to detect by asking “Why do I need to pay an upfront fee for this?”

Last one I saw was a required on-line credit che,ck (something like $40) for renting a property. The scammers owned the purported credit check portal and it is difficult to show that they are associated with any (ficticious) property listings.

@ ALL,

I read this in the quote,

> “*Nigeria, scamsters often manage to get LinkedIn users to share their login credentials with the lure of paid work, preying on their desperation amid an especially acute unemployment crisis.*“

And I immediately think,

“Unemployment crisis only in Nigeria?”

It may not be as bad in the UK as it is in the US or many other countries. But the real unemployment rate is rising.

A big indicator of this is the so called “gig economy”…

But as is often the case you have to pay someone to get into such jobs or “rent equipment”.

Sometimes it’s difficult to tell the difference between an “employer” or someone “on the take”.

I’ve mentioned in the past a UK Hospital in South West London, that had nearly all the “out sourced” cleaning staff from ISS Mediclean taken away and three managers arrested,

<https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/4750593.blackmail-arrests-at-kingston-hospital-contractor/>

This sort of thing is not exactly uncommon.

Another example is of an unqualified person “borrowing” for kickback a qualified nurses ID and “working bank” through an agency.

Then there are… Delivery people who are not legally allowed to work, who take over accounts and bikes etc for those who are allowed to work.

One person was found to have six such gig-jobs, yet was actually working full time. Basically they had rented out the gig-jobs to “illegals” at 25% fee each.

The list goes on and on.

In LinkedIn’s self-reported transparency center, the charts overwhelmingly show that the platform’s automated defenses are removing a very high percentages of fake accounts (97.1%) and spam and scams (98.7%). In this regard, it’s amazing that members still reported 385,900 spam and scams in the most recent reporting period.

In the government data request section, I’m curious why not every country from this article is listed.

I’m glad articles like the one in the OP are being published. People may not know to be aware. It says a lot that people were willing to share their personal stories to capture the nuances of these encounters.

But I still can’t figure out why someone made a fake profile (with fake publications even), trying to make a connection.
I spotted it because he claimed that I was a coauthor on one of the articles 🙂

I have a piece on LinkedIn job scams. Part of the problem is that LinkedIn makes it very difficult to have these bogus profiles deactivated.

Even when I show them evidence from the employer that the person pretending to be an employee is not employed there, LinkedIn won’t delete the profile.

They simply do not care.

@

With regards LinkedIn and,

> “They simply do not care.”

They do, but it’s only about the bottom line.

Almost from the day LinkedIn got going they did questionable things that could make the owner of what was FaceBook –now meta– look honourable to grow membership.

Perhaps the least offensive thing they did was to without permission access your “contacts list” and them spam people saying that you had “recommend them”…

Not true as the Managing Director at a company I had worked for had to send out an apology EMail back then.

I’ve therefore not had any contact with LinkedIn and try and avoid going to any pages associated to them.

However I’ve spoken to others and they have told me other “Horror Stories” about LinkedIn. Which as I’ve not directly witnessed I will not repeat (other than to say “apparently” they were quite litigious in the past).

But I will note that LinkedIn were sufficient “nuisance / harassment” for me to dump my private EMail account. And let’s just say Cory Doctorow 2022 comment on “Enshittification” certainly applies to LinkedIn in all but one respect…

“There was no move to such behaviour by LinkedIn… they were like that from day one.”

From mine and others observations of them, I guess it was a “founders decision”[1]

[1] They are reported to be, Allen Blue, Konstantin Guericke, Eric Ly, Jean-Luc Vaillan, and Reid Hoffman.

It appears Hoffman was the driving force behind al...
