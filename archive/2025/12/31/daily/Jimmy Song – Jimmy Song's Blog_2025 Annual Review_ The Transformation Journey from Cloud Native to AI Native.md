> The waves of technology keep evolving; only by actively embracing change can we continue to create value. In 2025, I chose to move from Cloud Native to AI Native—this year marked a key turning point for personal growth and system reinvention.

2025 was a turning point for me. This year, I not only changed my technical direction but also the way I approach problems. Moving from Cloud Native infrastructure to AI Native infrastructure was not just a migration of content, but an upgrade in mindset.

Figure 1: Farewell 2025!

This year, I conducted a large-scale refactoring of the website and systematically organized the content. Beyond the technical improvements, I want to share my thoughts and changes throughout the year.

## A Bold Shift: Embracing the AI Native Era

At the beginning of 2025, I made an important decision: to reposition myself from a Cloud Native Evangelist to an AI Infrastructure Architect. This was not just a change in title, but a strategic transformation after careful consideration.

As I witnessed the surge of AI technologies and the rise of Agent-based applications reshaping software, I realized that clinging to the boundaries of Cloud Native might mean missing an era. So, I systematically adjusted the website’s content structure, shifting the focus toward AI Native infrastructure.

This transformation was not about abandoning the past, but extending forward from the foundation of Cloud Native. Classic content like Kubernetes and Istio remains and is continuously updated, but new topics such as AI Agent and the AI OSS landscape have been added, forming a more complete knowledge map.

## Content Creation: From Technical Details to Ecosystem Perspective

### AI Agent: Building Systematic Knowledge

Agents represent a major evolution in software for the AI era. When I tried to understand Agent design principles, I found fragmented information everywhere but lacked a systematic knowledge base.

So I created content that analyzes the Agent context lifecycle and control loop mechanisms, summarizing several proven architectural patterns. To make complex knowledge easier to digest, I organized it into logical sections so readers can learn step by step.

### AI Tool Ecosystem: Mapping the Open Source Landscape

AI tools and frameworks are emerging rapidly, with new projects appearing daily. To help readers quickly grasp the ecosystem, I built a comprehensive AI OSS database.

This database covers everything from Agent frameworks to development tools and deployment services. I not only included active projects but also established an archive mechanism, preserving detailed information on over 150 historical projects. More importantly, I developed a scoring system to objectively evaluate projects across dimensions like quality and sustainability, helping readers decide which tools are worth investing time in.

### Blogging: Capturing Technology Trends Faster

In 2025, I wrote over 120 blog posts. Compared to previous years, these articles focused more on observing and reflecting on technology trends, rather than just technical tutorials.

I started paying attention to deeper questions: How will AI infrastructure evolve? What does Beijing’s open source initiative mean for the AI industry? What ripple effects might a tech acquisition trigger? These articles allowed me and my readers to not only see “what” technology is, but also “why” and “what’s next.”

## User Experience: Making Knowledge Easier to Discover and Consume

No matter how good the content is, if it can’t be easily found and read, its value is greatly diminished. In 2025, I invested significant effort into website functionality, with one goal: to provide readers with a smoother reading experience.
