In 2025, elected officials across the country began treating surveillance technology purchases differently: not as inevitable administrative procurements handled by police departments, but as political decisions subject to council oversight and constituent pressure. This shift proved to be the most effective anti-surveillance strategy of the year.

Since February, at least 23 jurisdictions fully ended, cancelled, or rejected Flock Safety ALPR programs (including [Austin](https://thedailytexan.com/2025/06/15/austin-to-end-license-plate-data-collection-program-following-audit-community-pushback/), [Oak Park](https://www.oakpark.com/2025/08/07/oak-park-terminates-flock-license-plate-reader-contract/), [Evanston](https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/cities-shut-down-flock-camera-networks-following-improper-access-by-federal-agencies/), [Hays County](https://universitystar.com/33412/news/hays-becomes-first-county-in-texas-to-end-alpr-contract/), [San Marcos](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/san-marcos-city-council-votes-to-deny-flock-camera-expansion-after-hours-of-heated-debate), [Eugene, Springfield](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/06/eugene-springfield-end-flock-cameras/), and [Denver](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/denver-city-council-rejects-extention-flock-safety-cameras/)) by recognizing surveillance procurement as political power, not administrative routine.
