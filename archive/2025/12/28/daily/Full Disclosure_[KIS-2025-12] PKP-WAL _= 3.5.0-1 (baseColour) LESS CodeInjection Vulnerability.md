-----------------------------------------------------------------
PKP-WAL <= 3.5.0-1 (baseColour) LESS Code Injection Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Links:

https://pkp.sfu.ca
https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib

[-] Affected Versions:

PKP Web Application Library (aka PKP-WAL or pkp-lib) version 3.4.0-9
and prior versions, and version 3.5.0-1 and prior versions, as used in
Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and Open
Preprint Systems (OPS).

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists within the PKPTemplateManager::compileLess()
method. This will call the Less_Parser::parse() method by using the
"addLessVariables", which can be manipulated when updating "Theme
Settings". Specifically, user input passed through the "baseColour"
parameter to the .../api/v1/contexts/1/theme API endpoint is not
properly sanitized before being added to the "addLessVariables", and
this can be exploited to perform LESS Code Injection attacks,
subsequently leading to SSRF or Local File Read attacks.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with
permissions to access the .../api/v1/institutions API endpoint, such
as a "Journal Editor" or "Production Editor" user account on OJS.

[-] Solution:

Upgrade to versions 3.4.0-10, 3.5.0-2, or later.
