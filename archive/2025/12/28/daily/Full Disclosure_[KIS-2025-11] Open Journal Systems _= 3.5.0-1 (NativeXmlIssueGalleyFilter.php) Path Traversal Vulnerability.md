Open Journal Systems <= 3.5.0-1 (NativeXmlIssueGalleyFilter.php) Path
Traversal Vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Links:

https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/
https://github.com/pkp/ojs

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 3.3.0-21 and prior versions.
Version 3.4.0-9 and prior versions.
Version 3.5.0-1 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because user input passed to the "Native XML
Plugin" through the issue -> issue_galleys -> issue_galley ->
issue_file -> file_name tag of the imported XML file is not properly
sanitized before being used to set the "server-side file name", which
is later used as the final part of a variable which is used at in a
call to the writeFile() method without proper validation. This can be
exploited to write/overwrite arbitrary files on the web server via
Path Traversal sequences, potentially leading to, e.g., execution of
arbitrary PHP code (RCE).

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with
permissions to access the "Import/Export" plugin ("Native XML
Plugin"), such as a "Journal Editor" or "Production Editor" user
account. Furthermore, in order to perform the following Remote Code
Execution (RCE) attack, the attacker should know or guess/disclose the
webserver path in which OJS is located (e.g.
/var/www/html/ojs-3.5.0-1).

[-] Solution:

Upgrade to versions 3.3.0-22, 3.4.0-10, 3.5.0-2, or later.
