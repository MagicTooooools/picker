## Europe Goes All in On Breaking Encryption, Mostly Fails (For Now)

The European Union Council has [repeatedly tried](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0) to pass a controversial message scanning proposal, known as “Chat Control,” that would require secure messaging providers to scan the contents of messages. Every time this has come up since it was [first introduced in 2022](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/eu-commissions-new-proposal-would-undermine-encryption-and-scan-our-messages), it [got batted down](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/once-again-chat-control-flails-after-strong-public-pressure)—because no matter how you slice it, [client-side scanning breaks end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption).
