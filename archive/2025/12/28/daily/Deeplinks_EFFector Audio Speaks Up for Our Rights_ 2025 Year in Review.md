This year, you may have heard EFF sounding off about our civil liberties on [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5597010/openai-atlas-browser-chatgpt-data-privacy), [BBC Radio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002b719), or [any](https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/ice-partners-with-israeli-phone-hacking-spyware/id1449762156?i=1000725826500) [number](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/terms-of-service-with-clare-duffy/id1777077679) of podcasts.
