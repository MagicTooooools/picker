PKP-WAL <= 3.5.0-1 (Institution Collector) SQL Injection Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Links:

https://pkp.sfu.ca
https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib

[-] Affected Versions:

PKP Web Application Library (aka PKP-WAL or pkp-lib) version 3.4.0-9
and prior versions, and version 3.5.0-1 and prior versions, as used in
Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and Open
Preprint Systems (OPS).

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the /classes/institution/Collector.php
script. Specifically, into the Collector::getQueryBuilder() method,
where user input passed through the "searchPhrase" GET parameter is
not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query at
lines 143 and 148 by leveraging the DB::raw() method. This can be
exploited by malicious users to e.g. read sensitive data from the
database through boolean-based or time-based SQL Injection attacks.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with
permissions to access the .../api/v1/institutions API endpoint, such
as a "Journal Editor" or "Production Editor" user account on OJS.

[-] Proof of Concept:

https://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2025-67889.php
