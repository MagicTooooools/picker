Threat: Backdoor.Win32.ControlTotal.t
Vulnerability: Insecure Credential Storage
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 2032 and requires authentication. The password "jdf4df4vdf" is stored in cleartext within the PE file. We send using a custom client to validate the password, as the malware did not like nc64 likely due to CRLF characters.
Family: ControlTotal
Type: PE32
Attack-pattern TTP: Unsecured Credentials (T1552)
MD5: 6c0eda1210da81b191bd970cb0f8660a
